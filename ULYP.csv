Seeking an opportunity to escape the cacophonous city, my companions and I resolved to seek a spot where we could lounge and engage in meaningful conversations. A spot that offered natural scenery such as trees, and an accompanying view of the ocean, with a suitable spot where we could hook up our hammocks and immerse ourselves in the soothing tranquility of the surroundings.

After several moments of contemplation and scrutiny, we finally hit the jackpot - the perfect location. A site that boasted an ocean view, and an ample array of trees, and its proximity made it all the more alluring. However, our bubble of excitement soon burst as we encountered an eyesore; the location was covered in filth and litter was strewn everywhere. It was apparent that the area had been overlooked for a considerable length of time, and as a result, was in dire need of a thorough cleanup.
Undaunted, we resolved to tackle the cleaning task head-on, employing eco-friendly practices and cautiously disposing of the waste. Despite the apparent uphill task, we worked cohesively as a team, utilizing the synergistic energy of our bursty approaches, to transform the once ugly and sordid location into a beautiful and serene spot.

Our altruistic actions proved so fulfilling that we resolved to make it a routine activity, scheduling our future visits to include cleaning the spot, the surrounding beach areas, and nearby open spaces. The tradition was so thrilling and fulfilling that we eagerly anticipated our future cleanups, finding great joy and satisfaction in our ability to return the area to its former pristine state.
 
Our initial goal of seeking a spot to relax and interact with each other led us to discover a hidden treasure, which we went ahead to revive and maintain through a regular practice of collective cleaning.

Yes,Male,2021-2022,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,UNRWA,No,Life Sciences - LS,76.275,0.7875,0.522,Yes,1 time,"   The moment I saw starving kids in the camp streets, I knew I would do whatever I could to save them. As a volunteer in the Al-Wakie organization, I distributed food for people who struggled during those harsh economic situations. As part of my voluntary work, I organized roles for each member of my team. In my three months volunteering, I learned a lot as a leader and as a person. As a leader, I carried the same behavior I portrayed towards my siblings. One of my favorite memories happened when I saw the sparkle on people's faces when given the food boxes. I believe that no one should be left behind. What made me a unique leader was the love and care people had given me, till now those people ask about me. Besides, the manager told me:' I am very astonished by the unconditional love people have for you.'
The most community service accomplishment that I am proud of is the work I did to help organize the gathering of the number of boxes that should be distributed the time for each drive. The event lasted five hours a day over three months. Almost 150 families were given the food aid boxes throughout the day. 

   As a result of my community service, I learned to become a good role model by teaching my peers and guiding them. I used to organize all of my team trips. Moreover, I learned to take everything seriously and put effort into every task, and because of that, I became a leader in the Al-Wakaa organization. I used to play rugby with Beirut Rugby, in addition to playing basketball with the participation of Dar Al- Shaikhoha, and the manager ""Sahar Serhan"" was responsible for it. I have learned many life lessons from her, she was my inspiration. What made those activities more spectacular is my dedication to improve myself, and learn new skills.

   To conclude, volunteering at my camp and all of the extra voluntary work I had done has a great experience. By leading most of the volunteers' tasks and participating in special events, I became better at public speaking and more comfortable starting conversations with people. In return, I was able to get more people in the community interested in computers, and I look forward to studying this major in college and hopefully continuing my volunteer work at my university.

However, outside the academic state, there are many traits that make me a unique and special individual.  

Taking workshops is always on my list when I have time, since it contributes advancement and strengthen my CV. The latest workshop I did was getting a course from Google about marketing and I spent 40 hours learning it. Also I had another workshop last year about Digital media literacy by Dot and I spent 2 months learning it and I got 89%in the final exam. In addition to many zoom classes that was talking about photography skills, Marketing in social media, time managing… However, the last month I finished a workshop that is a medical one explaining the main systems in the body(nervous, glycemic, circulatory…) to prepare us for studying it in the university. On the other hand, every summer I participate in courses about different topics and at the end I participate in its final ceremony and help them in preparing for it. 

Every is unique, but what makes each individual unique is often hard to describe. For me, I am a problem solver individual that tries to find a solution for every obstacle and find the bright side in its dark ones, since every obstacle come for a reason and fighting against it makes you. However, I think outside the box with respect to the most thinking of my generation. For instance, I always put many plans for the same point to achieve it and don’t give it any chance to fail, and I always try to create new opportunities. For example, I had a platform on social media that I did marketing on it in order to fill my time and help family financially, but its work has paused since I entered grade 12, and another trait that helped me in that; that if I put a certain idea in my mind, I don’t leave it until I ace it. Moreover, I am a responsible girl, where I always try to get tasks that make a difference in the community, since everyday is a chance to make a difference regardless how small it is. And I always try to show my best since as I am the older sister, I am the leader ones.

One of the projects that I have worked on is activities for autistic kids. Autism is a developmental disorder that affects a person's ability to communicate and interact with others. By organizing activities for autistic kids, I have helped them improve their social skills and self-confidence. These activities could have included games, art classes, and other interactive sessions that are specifically designed for children with autism. By doing this, I have given these children the opportunity to have fun and learn new skills in a safe and inclusive environment.

Another project that I have been a part of is the Model Good Governance campaign, which was launched at LAU in 2020. This initiative aimed to challenge Lebanese high school students to simulate international organizations that tackle different aspects of good governance. These students were divided into seven sectors, each representing a different summit, including Economy, Education, Election/Human Rights, Emergencies/Health, Environment, Refugees/Displacement, and Youth Leadership. By participating in this campaign, I have helped to promote good governance and develop the skills of  me as a young person.

I also contributed to a music choral at the National Evangelical Institute for Girls and Boys with Mr. Jack Nehme for two years. This project provided a platform for us, young people, to showcase our musical talents and work together to create beautiful performances. By participating in this choral, I have not only enriched your musical abilities but have also learned the value of teamwork and collaboration.

Lastly, I participated in an online workshop called Innovation Camp INJAZ Lebanon in partnership with ToRead, which introduced youth to entrepreneurship. This workshop helped me develop my entrepreneurial skills and learn about different business strategies. It provided me with the tools and knowledge necessary to turn my ideas into a successful business venture.

In conclusion, my involvement in these various projects, campaigns, and workshops has allowed me to make a significant impact in your community.

One of my most significant volunteering experiences has been helping to distribute food and donations to refugees and needy people in my neighborhood. In a country where the economical situation is dreadful, I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to contribute in my own small way. My role involved sorting and packaging food and other essential items, as well as delivering them to those in need. Seeing the smiles on people's faces as they received the aid they needed was truly gratifying. This experience was really rewarding as it taught me a lot about the power of community. I learned that by coming together, we can make a difference in the lives of those who are struggling. 

      Aside from volunteering with food distribution, I have also been involved in destigmatizing mental illness. Several people have opened up to me about their struggles with mental health, and I have sought to acknowledge their feelings and destigmatize their experience of seeking help and going to therapy. I believe that mental health stigma should be ended, and various misconceptions have to be corrected. Through these efforts, I have learned the necessity of raising awareness about the importance of mental health and the resources available to those who are struggling. 

     Overall, these experiences have taught me the value of service. I learned that sometimes individuals might be incapable of implementing a large scale solution to a large scale problem, but they are perfectly capable of closing a gap that needs to be closed.

Without direct involvement in real-world situations, whether in your field or not, you probably won't go very far. Unfortunately, the past two years didn't allow for many outdoor activities or initiatives, causing me to miss out on opportunities to shine beyond academics. However, this year I joined the Shabab Lab Bridge Program, which proved immensely valuable for my personal development. Through the program, I not only improved my communication skills but also gained valuable entrepreneurial skills that I otherwise would have had to wait a long time to learn. These skills include understanding the dynamics and logistics of building a startup, the process of generating and filtering ideas, and how to pitch those ideas to potential investors. After undergoing extensive training, my team and I leveraged the techniques and knowledge we had acquired to build our own small business. The experience was both challenging and enjoyable, requiring us to work tirelessly. Although we did not emerge victorious, we were proud of our achievements and grateful for the valuable experience we gained.

At intermediate school, I was so interested in theatre that I performed several plays during the school festivals, and sometimes I recited some poems. I am also interested in growing plants. I enjoy cultivating seeds and flowers. When I try to plant a small soul in our garden, I feel at ease since I enjoy watching it grow and taking good care of it. To plant as much as possible last year, my neighbor and I set a goal of planting at least 10 different kinds of beans and veggies. I would like to repeat it every year because it was such a memorable experience. I intend to volunteer with the June 2020-founded KLNA NGO. It aims to help reduce and end poverty, achieve food security and help end hunger by promoting sustainable agriculture as a response to one of the worst economic crises in Lebanon's history.

   During Model Arab League (MAL), I encountered being responsible and accountable under pressure, which made me acquire executive leadership and time-management skills. While getting ready for the final conference, my co-delegate and I were supposed to finish the speeches and the position paper before the deadline even though we had upcoming midterms at that time. This experience made me learn the skills needed for successful group work under pressure, which are time-management, leadership, commitment, and the ability to stay determined despite facing obstacles. At the final conference, I delivered my speeches in collaboration with my teammate, using some public speaking skills to convince the President of how our country excelled in the specific topic comparing to other Arab countries. Standing on the platform and expressing my ideas on ways to solve problems our countries get affected by everyday made me realize how essential it is to change our political systems to empower the youth and their ideas. I remember pausing for a moment and thinking, “Oh my god so youth are actually really powerful and have the ability to change the flaws in our societies and we are actually trying to??”, which is really weird because I thought I did believe in the power of youth before, but MAL implemented this belief and internalized it in my head. During the conference, I also had to be consistent in debating to get the other delegates to agree to our ideas on how to solve issues. Overall, In addition to teaching me a lot about diplomacy and politics, MAL personally taught me leadership, management, and effective communication skills, while also strengthening my public speaking skills and boosting my self-confidence. 
   Working on 18 in Saida 2020 Project, we had to journal to introduce people around the world on many different aspects of what teens residing in Saida live and expect to change when they turn 18. I chose to write about Education, in which I explained about what would change when we go to university. I also made sure to write about how the current Lebanese Education System affects us and how we’d be able to change a lot in our systems if we had the right chance to proper education that empowers our creative ideas. After finishing working on the Project and successfully releasing our booklet, the journalist Jan Vincent Steens also asked us to write about various topics like Ramadan, Eid, Optimism, and Expecting life in Lebanon in 2024 specially in camps, so I wrote passionately to contribute in introducing other people on our lifestyles and what is going here in Lebanon. I remember the journalist literally told me stuff like “It is beautiful, well written!”, “So good written Farah! You have a good pen.”, “It is good that you waited for inspiration, because this is so good. You sum things up in a way. Thank you!”... 
   This summer, I participated in All Girls Code Techsplore Program, where I’ve met AUB students who are inspiring young women in STEM, who didn’t just teach me a brief introduction to coding languages like HTML, JavaScript, and Python, but also made sure to empower me as a girl in a way I cannot describe. They made sure to show us that making difference as an Arab girl in STEM is indeed possible, by showing us presentations about remarkable Arab women in Tech-fields.
  Moreover, I also participated in a few workshops like the Innovation Camp, Community Service workshop that introduces us to how we should deal with stressful changes in our lives due to Coronavirus, etc...During these workshops, I showed my passion for these topics by giving ideas that are innovative in which the judges expressed admiration for. In the innovation camp, I took charge of the project with another girl since the rest of the members didn’t participate, and I also introduced it to the judges because the other girl found difficulties in using English language. My team ended up winning 2nd place, and I was really happy since I learned a lot and enjoyed the process of introducing our idea that is environmental-friendly and also profits entrepreneurs. 
 Additionally, I'm a current participant in the Change Program of ULYP, where I attend English Language and also life-skills sessions.
 Overall, I do really enjoy social activities and workshops, and I look forward to participating in more activities.

It can also help you find friends and connect with the community. 

I volunteered at the Nawat Organization as a teacher's assistant, which is a social solidarity center. We taught illiterate children and children who had dropped out of school. We do activities for them so that they will feel like any other student in school and have a brilliant future. In addition, I participated in a campaign at my secondary school, Amqa. I was an active member of the recycling club to preserve the environment and ensure its health. I also participated with Toread in the Introduction to Scientific Research Program and the Innovation Camp (ICAMP), where we attended sessions on Zoom and met new friends as we worked as a team, and I have a certificate from them.

I have always been an empathetic person, and I enjoy listening to others and learning from their experiences. Whether it's a friend, family member, or stranger, I always try to make people feel seen and heard.

Another thing that sets me apart from others is my passion for creativity.I find that being creative is a great way to express myself and let go of any stress or negative emotions I might be feeling. Whether I'm writing a poem,playing video games , or simply doodling in my notebook, I always try to let my imagination run wild.

In addition to my empathy and creativity, I also value my sense of adventure. I love exploring new places, trying new foods, and meeting new people. Whether it's a road trip across the country or a hike through the mountains, I always try to find ways to challenge myself and step outside of my comfort zone.

One other thing that sets me apart is my curiosity about the world around me. I am always seeking out new information, whether it's about science, history, or culture. I enjoy reading books, watching documentaries, and learning from experts in different fields. I find that my curiosity fuels my passion for learning and helps me grow as a person.For several years, I was a member of a local football club, where I played as a striker. Being a part of this club was an incredibly fulfilling experience, as it not only allowed me to stay active and healthy, but it also helped me develop important life skills, such as teamwork, leadership, and perseverance.

One thing that I loved about being a part of the football club was the sense of camaraderie that we shared as a team. We worked together to achieve our goals, and we always had each other's backs both on and off the field. This sense of community was incredibly valuable to me, as it helped me develop strong relationships with my teammates and coaches.

Playing football also helped me develop my leadership skills. As a striker, I was often responsible for directing the team's attacks and coordinating with my fellow players to score goals. This experience taught me how to communicate effectively, delegate tasks, and motivate others to perform at their best.

Finally, playing football taught me the value of perseverance. Despite setbacks and losses, we always bounced back and continued to work hard to improve our skills and performance. This determination and resilience have served me well in all aspects of my life, both personally and professionally.

 I believe that what makes me special is my commitment to helping others. Whether it's volunteering at a local charity, mentoring a younger sibling, or simply being there for a friend in need, I always try to make a positive impact on the world around me. I believe that we all have a responsibility to use our skills and talents to make the world a better place, and I take that responsibility seriously.

In conclusion, what makes me special outside of my school work is my ability to connect with others, my creativity, my sense of adventure, my curiosity, and my commitment to helping others. These traits have helped me grow as a person and have given me a sense of purpose and fulfillment in life. I believe that everyone has unique qualities that make them special, and it's important to embrace those qualities and use them to make a positive impact on the world.",0,Lebanese American University (LAU),No,Married,Yes,No,No,No,No,0,No,Done,Done,336,Eligible,Not Considered,Expenses Higher,0,TRUE,0,Low,make special outside work ability connect people understand need always empathetic person enjoy listening others learning experience whether friend family member stranger always try make people feel seen heard another thing set apart others passion creativityi find creative great way express let go stress negative emotion might feeling whether im writing poemplaying video game simply doodling notebook always try let imagination run wild addition empathy creativity also value sense adventure love exploring new place trying new food meeting new people whether road trip across country hike mountain always try find way challenge step outside comfort zone one thing set apart curiosity world around always seeking new information whether science history culture enjoy reading book watching documentary learning expert different field find curiosity fuel passion learning help grow personfor several year member local football club played striker part club incredibly fulfilling experience allowed stay active healthy also helped develop important life skill teamwork leadership perseverance one thing loved part football club sense camaraderie shared team worked together achieve goal always others back field sense community incredibly valuable helped develop strong relationship teammate coach playing football also helped develop leadership skill striker often responsible directing team attack coordinating fellow player score goal experience taught communicate effectively delegate task motivate others perform best finally playing football taught value perseverance despite setback loss always bounced back continued work hard improve skill performance determination resilience served well aspect life personally professionally believe make special commitment helping others whether volunteering local charity mentoring younger sibling simply friend need always try make positive impact world around believe responsibility use skill talent make world better place take responsibility seriously conclusion make special outside school work ability connect others creativity sense adventure curiosity commitment helping others trait helped grow person given sense purpose fulfillment life believe everyone unique quality make special important embrace quality use make positive impact world,0.21283866,Nothing,2,4,0,9,4,0,0,2,2

Growing up in a relatively stable environment in Lebanon, I consider myself fortunate, unlike the Palestinians living in occupied Palestine who face physical and mental abuse from Israeli forces daily, and the Palestinians living in refugee camps in Lebanon who endure harsh living conditions. Given my privilege, I have always felt a sense of responsibility to help those in need. As soon as I was old enough, I did my best to offer assistance. The conditions inside Palestinian refugee camps were particularly dire, with buildings on the verge of collapse, people sleeping on the floor, and children running around barefoot. Basic services like clean water and sanitation, as well as economic opportunities, were also limited. In fact, I once met a group of kids from multiple families who shared a single room, and my heart ached for them. That's when I decided to teach these kids English, realizing that it is increasingly important in today's globalized world, as it is the most widely spoken language and the primary language of communication for educational and professional goals. I volunteered at the Social and Cultural Nashet Association and went to a local school every weekday to read to the children. Then, I had each of them pick out a book, and I took turns helping them read, gradually teaching them the language. Over time, some of them learned how to read and speak English, and a few even became fluent. I hope that my efforts were enough to change at least one child's life for the better. As I grew older, my desire to help others expanded beyond just my fellow Palestinians. I wanted to extend a helping hand to people in Lebanon who were struggling to survive during these difficult times. Hence, I joined the Interact Club of Saida, a volunteer group that is dedicated to raising awareness and funds for various causes. Our group works tirelessly to organize events that raise awareness and generate funds for our causes. We put a lot of effort into securing sponsorships for our events so that we can cover the costs and maximize the amount of money we can donate. Each year, we focus on a specific group or minority in need, and this year, we have been working to cover tuition costs for as many children as possible. Through our hard work, we were able to cover tuition costs for over 40 children at ""????? ??????? ? ???????"" (Maternal and Childhood Care). It's been incredibly rewarding to see the impact we can make when we come together as a community and work toward a common goal.

It was based in Taamir Ain Al Helwi, which is a really poor place in Saida, and this project's main goal was to revive it. This project included distribution of food supplies, free checkups, diverse awareness sessions, kermes for children, and entertainment evening. I was a part in all of that, and my main task was photography; I took photos and some videos, within a team, for all the project so that to be shared on Facebook and shed light on this place. 
I also had a beautiful experience participating in Modal Arab League and Modal United Nations at LAU and won position paper award in MAL. I was glad to participate in making decisions and suggesting solutions for conflicts we are really suffering from; it gives a sense of leadership. Besides, working in teams enhanced the spirit of cooperation in us and helped in making new friends.
During pandemic, I attended several online meetings to benefit from my free time. One of them was about surviving COVID-19 pandemic organized by USAID students at LAU.
I also participate in political meeting and seminars because I believe politics play an important role in our lives; politics are in every single part of our lives. So, I'm interested in knowing more about them and in understanding the real conflict of Lebanon, which is all related to politics. Furthermore, I like-it's even my responsibility- to be part of solidarity gatherings in support of Palestine. For instance, there were such gatherings last year during the continuous bombing of Gaza. Palestine needs our support no matter where and how! In light of what was mentioned, one of my goals through my major is to support Palestine and to be the unheard voice of every Palestinian.
Last but not least, scout is also where I spend a lot of my time outside school. It includes charitable activities, beneficial meetings, and entertainment as well. It helps me improve my leadership skills, make new social relationships, and work in teams. Besides, the photographer of the scout; I take photos and videos for all the activities and their preparations, and I really love to do so.
No doubt that school must be our priority, and it's the place where we prepare ourselves, discover our abilities and skills, build friendships, and get ready for university, but there's a world outside that we need to discover and a personality to build. This world is the place where we are going to apply what we have learned and that we want to make it better.

Through this experience, I gained a lot of skills and met a lot of people, youth, children and caregivers. I was able to set my best potentials in the right place. Although I was not perfect in everything, I am glad and proud that I’ve been a hard working person, trying to give my best to fulfil required tasks. Because I am friendly and flexible, good communicator and children lover, I become a facilitator of the children program implemented at the organization. I proved good communication and fast learning skills. I contributed to set new ideas for the children activities and was able to implement full sessions. I have successfully reached out to around 150 people to join the organization’s activities.
In response to COVID-19 pandemic, I participated in an awareness campaign in Wadi Elzaini, distributing masks to people in the whole area, as well as giving them awareness tips and advises. Another campaign carried out by Aljana, “For Beirut”, after the big explosion of Beirut port, gave me the opportunity to get involved in helping affected people, cleaning with them and removing harmful materials.
I also participated in the national campaign for vaccination against measles and polio in different countries around Lebanon. We walked an artistic parade composed of musicians and artists with big puppets to raise awareness and encourage parents to vaccinate their children.
I participated with 48-hr life skills workshop, by which we have covered skills like, Self-esteem, Stress Management, Time management, Positive Communication, Creative Thinking, initiatives and community service. This workshop helped me improve my character after practicing the taught skills. 
I have also participated in a workshop by UNICEF, carrying life skills, child protection, and psychological support topics. Furthermore, I attended 32 hours of puppet making training, film making training, participated in Al Jana’s international Film Festival and now I am participating in robotics workshop. Besides my role in the book club where I am part of organizing it. 
Moreover, I volunteered with Jeel Sustainable Development (NPO) on its project ""??? ? ?????"" in which we distributed games, gifts, and clothes for children in need.

It was a really eye opening experience as to how cruel the world around us can be, and how you as an individual can serve to relieve the pain of whoever was dealt a bad hand by life. We often visited children's hospitals here in Lebanon, leaving the little souls toys in our wake, trying to paint smiles on their small faces wherever we went. We also served to help supply a local shelter with food and clothing, each of our 18 members contributing as much as possible to help those less fortunate and in need. We regularly held fundraiser bake sales to support our cause, often paying for most of the event from our own pockets, with little to no personal gain other than the satisfaction of serving someone a delicious pastry, and using the money they spent for the even greater satisfaction of helping the people who really need it. Excluding in school activity, I've also participated in many fundraiser football games held by the team I play for, usually aimed to support small businesses and families who are much less fortunate than we are.

As I mentioned in a previous answer, I volunteered at Al-Montada Tullabi, which focuses on youth work by providing volunteer opportunities and organizing activities for school and university students. During my stay there, I:
•	Assisted in organizing, coordinating, and implementing charitable projects.  
•	Helped in distributing clothes and food aid to refugees in Lebanon.
•	Participated in educational and awareness youth workshops.
Volunteering in a humanitarian organization has been a good experience for me. I was able to develop interpersonal and communication skills that will serve me well in my future academic and professional work. As a volunteer, I was required to collaborate with other volunteers and staff personnel to achieve common goals. This experience taught me the value of good communication, problem-solving, and leadership abilities.
In addition, I participated in the Young Empowered Secondary Students (YESS) program by the Lebanese Association for Scientific Research (LASeR). This program provided me with academic assistance as well as possibilities for skill development. The program contributed to improving my academic level, especially in scientific and language subjects.
Moreover, I was also a part of a soccer club in Tripoli. As a member of this club, I learned valuable lessons about teamwork, communication, and leadership that are applicable to my future academic and professional pursuits.
Outside of school, what distinguishes me is my ability to moderate academic responsibilities with educational activities. I am a committed and dynamic guy that takes great satisfaction while performing tasks. With my volunteer and extracurricular activities, I have developed my communication, leadership, and problem-solving abilities. These abilities will be useful as I continue my education in computer engineering and contribute to my future professional success.

In other words, volunteering means that someone is giving their time to help an individual, a group of people, or a nonprofit organization. People volunteer for many different reasons, such as to help others, to gain new skills, to meet new people, or to have fun.
I'm a volunteer in the Nuwat social solidarity center association, where I volunteer at an education project as a teacher assistant to help teach students. We are teaching illiterate children and those who get out of school, especially females. We were seeking to insure a safe, healthy, and better future for them. We tried to send students back to school, sometimes trying to convince parents and tell them the importance of education for their children in the future. This education program was not only for studying; it was also for entertainment so that they did not feel that they were different from other children in school.
Moreover, not only do I volunteer for organizations, but I also contribute to my school. I participated in the Reuse It campaigns as an efficient member of the recycling club. The aim of this service is to make sure that our school is eco-friendly in its classroom.
Moreover, I participated in the InJaz Lebanon Innovation Camp, which is a non-profit organization that aims to educate and encourage students to use critical thinking to learn entrepreneurial skills. Those skills include knowing what customers want and need, launching effective marketing campaigns, and creating a detailed business plan.
In my free time, I like to help the children of our neighbors in their studies for free without taking any rewards because their parents haven't completed their studies, so they cannot teach their children, and they do not have the ability to put them in expensive private lessons.
I am ambitious, optimistic, passionate, patient, creative, energetic, positive, and willing to help. I like to try new skills and experiences so that I can learn from them. Also, I'm confident and flexible, which help me form various relationships with people of various ages.
To end with, volunteers are the lifeblood of our society. A society where people volunteer and work together always faces fewer problems since all the members tend to get along well and support each other when they are in need. I enjoyed being part of something great that can improve myself, help someone's life, and make a difference in one's life as well as my own.",1,"American University of Beirut (AUB), Lebanese American University (LAU)",No,Married,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,0,No,Done,Done,394,Eligible,Considered,Income Higher,0,TRUE,1,Avg,volunteering unpaid work done person benefit community word volunteering mean someone giving time help individual group people nonprofit organization people volunteer many different reason help others gain new skill meet new people fun im volunteer nuwat social solidarity center association volunteer education project teacher assistant help teach student teaching illiterate child get school especially female seeking insure safe healthy better future tried send student back school sometimes trying convince parent tell importance education child future education program studying also entertainment feel different child school moreover volunteer organization also contribute school participated reuse campaign efficient member recycling club aim service make sure school ecofriendly classroom moreover participated injaz lebanon innovation camp nonprofit organization aim educate encourage student use critical thinking learn entrepreneurial skill skill include knowing customer want need launching effective marketing campaign creating detailed business plan free time like help child neighbor study free without taking reward parent havent completed study teach child ability put expensive private lesson ambitious optimistic passionate patient creative energetic positive willing help like try new skill experience learn also im confident flexible help form various relationship people various age end volunteer lifeblood society society people volunteer work together always face fewer problem since member tend get along well support need enjoyed part something great improve help someone life make difference one life well,0.192059721,Nothing,2,0,0,2,1,0,0,9,1

Whether it's volunteering at food banks or organizing a fundraising event for a charitable cause, I am always willing to step outside of my comfort zone and do what it takes to help others. My mentality has allowed me to grow as a person and has given me the opportunity to learn from people around me. 

All my extracurriculars are an image of my unwavering determination and perseverance, from being the president of the student council across 5 Makassed schools to representing my country in an exchange program in the US.

During my exchange program to DC, I encountered a substantial community of Muslims who were left with no viable food options due to the lack of halal food. Despite being assured that their needs would be attended to, they were left with only bread, butter, and rice to sustain themselves while watching others relish platefuls of mouthwatering dishes. This raised a religious conflict since sustenance is a fundamental human need that transcends religion. Even when they voiced their concerns, they were met with a dismissive response that further aggravated their dilemma. It was evident that this was a pressing issue, so I took it upon myself to approach the program heads. Some were dismissive, criticizing the girls’ lack of adaptation to a new environment, while others took responsibility and offered to arrange for halal food. I researched and recommended a local halal restaurant to the program manager, which resolved the issue effectively. I am currently serving as a member of the Alumnae advisory council in TechGirls, ensuring that future program participants' needs are met and readily available.

Being a helper in everything I do and taking leadership, not just in academic pursuits, is what I believe makes me special and important in my community. By putting myself on the line to help others, I have also gained a sense of purpose and fulfillment that I wouldn't have otherwise. Knowing that I have made a positive difference in someone's life, no matter how minor, fills me with happiness and pride.

Moving forward, I will continue to put myself on the line to help others in everything I do. I believe that by serving others, I am also serving myself and contributing to a better world for all.",0,"American University of Beirut (AUB), Lebanese American University (LAU)",No,Married,Yes,No,No,No,No,0,Yes,Done,Done,406,Eligible,Not Considered,Income Higher,0,TRUE,1,High,whether volunteering food bank organizing fundraising event charitable cause always willing step outside comfort zone take help others mentality allowed grow person given opportunity learn people around extracurriculars image unwavering determination perseverance president student council across 5 makassed school representing country exchange program u exchange program dc encountered substantial community muslim left viable food option due lack halal food despite assured need would attended left bread butter rice sustain watching others relish plateful mouthwatering dish raised religious conflict since sustenance fundamental human need transcends religion even voiced concern met dismissive response aggravated dilemma evident pressing issue took upon approach program head dismissive criticizing girl ’ lack adaptation new environment others took responsibility offered arrange halal food researched recommended local halal restaurant program manager resolved issue effectively currently serving member alumna advisory council techgirls ensuring future program participant need met readily available helper everything taking leadership academic pursuit believe make special important community putting line help others also gained sense purpose fulfillment wouldnt otherwise knowing made positive difference someone life matter minor fill happiness pride moving forward continue put line help others everything believe serving others also serving contributing better world,0.169633838,Real Estate,1,3,0,6,4,0,0,3,2

No,Female,2023-2024,No,No,Yes,No,Public,No,Life Sciences - LS,84.3,0.5375,0.65625,No,Not provided,"In 2018, I participated within my school with another school in a project about peace and war and we prepared many activities bearing the slogan of peace. These activities included a short theoretical work, drawing paintings, handicrafts, and a short documentary film was shown and we exchanged views and proposed solutions to reduce wars. I prepared an activity in which a number of students (in grade 5) participated. I made two boxes, the first expresses peace and the second expresses war, also I prepared words indicating war and peace, the students had to put the appropriate words in the appropriate box and at the end of the activity I gave the winner a small gift to encourage him.Secondly, when I was in elementary school the teacher chose me to participate in a drawing competition and I actually participated in it, but in fact I was not one of the winners, but it was a very beautiful, fun and unique experience.I met friends of different ages and that boosted my self confidence and I took a short tour by myself to see the incredible paintings, I also saw very nice handicrafts.  Third, in 2018 I participated in a charitable work within the school to help a school whose condition was not good, so every student had to bring things to donate to that school.  I collected clothes that no longer fit my size to donate and I collected money to buy toothbrush, hand lotion and socks. I did everything I could to participate in this charitable work. The important thing is to provide assistance, even if it's simple.Fourth, in the year 2019, the teacher chose two students, me and my friend and said that a TV channel will come to the school and will ask us some questions and we will answer them and express our opinion in some topics and among these questions is how education curriculum can be developed? and what do you not like about your study?.As for what makes me special outside my school work is love to help others. Some of my friends sometimes ask me to explain an idea that they didn't understand during the teacher's explanation, so I help them by sending them video clips or audio messages so that I can solve their problem.Also, I never hesitate when my neighbors ask me for help. In addition, I stand up for what is right, so when I see someone violating the rights of another or someone bullying another person without hesitation I stand with the oppressed and support him and defend him in a respectful manner and in a way that doesn't infringe on the person who committed the error. It's impossible for me to remain silent when I see such situations. Also there is something I love and feel happy when doing it, which is helping someone older than me or someone who has a disability. For example, there is a very long staircase near the building in which I live and climbing this staircase is very tiring, so I saw an old woman carrying bags and wanted to climb it, so I came to help her and the woman felt happy and she kept thanking me. Indeed, how beautiful it is to make another person happy. The help for us may be simple, but for the other person it means alot to him .Manners, my family and relatives always praise me in terms of good Manners. The most important thing in a person is his morals and inner beauty. Pedagogy is more important than science, for morals come first and I would like to thank God that I was brought up with beautiful morals and that I have wonderful parents who teach me what is right and teach me human values and principles such as respecting the old and the young and I like to give importance to the little ones when talking to them and letting them know that their talk is important to me. Tolerance, I love this moral value, how beautiful it is for a person to be tolerant of others. I am a very tolerant person with others and if someone makes a mistake against me I will never hold a grudge against him because Tolerance is a very important value in life without it people can't live in peace .

At eleven years old my mother registered me in a workshop in AUB about racism so I could know more about racism and maybe help achieve equality between each other in the future. Also at eleven years old my school made a campaign for cleaning the beach which I also participated in, it took us 8 hours to clean almost the whole beach but we stopped cleaning because it soon got dark so we had to go back home.
At the age of thirteen years old and I volunteered in a campaign for rescuing sea turtles, which means that we were gonna clean the sea from the plastic that was filling it which made sea turtles think that plastic bags are jellyfish and when they tried eating it they would suffocate and evantually die.
At the age of fifteen years old, a marathon was made for raising awareness against illiteracy which I participated in.
At the age of seventeen years old I participated in a campaign which was for me the best campaign ever which was for rescuing dogs from the streets because of corona people were afraid of their dogs being contaminated by the virus so they threw their dogs out of their houses which increased the number of dogs in the streets in the campaign I tried as much as possible to rescue these dogs and it was amazing how cooperative the dogs were while trying to help them.

For instance, I participated as a delegate in the 17th High School GC LAU Model United Nations Conference in 2020, which enhanced my communication, leadership, teamwork skills and instilled in me a sense of confidence and encouragement. Additionally, in 2021, I fulfilled the SAT courses, soft skills workshops, and research prerequisites for the Stream into College Program at American University of Beirut (AUB). This initiative enabled me to obtain many skills, advantages, and an improved comprehension of myself and my desired profession.
Furthermore, I attended several workshops with the Université Saint-Joseph de Beyrouth, where I obtained a certificate in student training for school mediation. This workshop provided me with valuable experiences of dealing with bullying and equipped me with the ability to solve any problem between two or more people through effective communication and collaboration. I also participated in the Global Student Summit ’21 on a virtual platform, where I represented Lebanon and my school on the theme of Zero Hunger. 
Additionally, I was part of the Global Conversation Project, which is supported by the British Council and the UK Aid. This program helped me gain more knowledge about the world's problems, particularly those caused by humans. I was also involved in a short acting show and a member of the orchestra team in the UNESCO in Lebanon about peace and war. The show was filmed and shared on TV and in the downtown area with the presence of Marwan Hamadeh -the Minister of Education -. 
Moreover, I received a certificate for helping to organize the 2021 Beirut Marathon Charity Run, which was organized by the Beirut Marathon Association. I was also involved in the affairs of Lebanese Spotlight and completed 100 hours of community service which included workshops such as, awareness campaigns, impact Beirut, capacity building, and other social initiatives. And I am still a member of it as a volunteer and a leader of the Ras Beirut school. 
Currently, I am participating in an eight-part workshop organized by Himaya NGO, which focuses on the vital issue of child labor. We explore its causes and effects and work together to create effective solutions to combat it.
Besides, I attended recently an online data analysis workshop funded by the Public Affairs Section at the US Embassy in Beirut, in collaboration with the NGO LARA. This workshop provided me with extensive knowledge and skills in working with the Excel program.
My specialness outside of school comes from the fact that, while I am an achiever in academics, I firmly believe that what defines an individual is their impact on society and how they use their abilities to help others. It is my ability to use my talents to make a difference in the world that sets me apart and brings me a sense of purpose and fulfillment.

Although the school does teach us the principles behind a good society, it lacks the space for the application. During the past few years, I was enlightened to engage with my area.
    During the month of Ramadan, I participated in the Iftar project at the Arab Palestinian Cultural Club. In a span of 20 days, I was in the field delivering meals- prepared in the club’s kitchens- to impoverished homes. Not only was it an act of good, but it also left a wholesome feeling of bonding with my people.
     In Grade 11, I participated with 4 of my classmates in the earth prize competition, which was an international competition that awarded young innovators with authentic ideas of projects that tackle an environmental issue. In a project that took months to complete, our creativity and problem-solving skills were challenged. We worked hard brainstorming, planning the scheme, researching online, and estimating the costs of implementation. we were asked to provide brief descriptions of our plan, illustrations of our model (In case there was a specific structure integrated into the solution), and a recitation of resources. Although we didn’t accomplish victory, we were taught responsibility and teamwork by being pushed out of our comfort zone.
    Another great project I was involved in was an event at my camp compromised of open space for local entrepreneurs with small businesses to sell and advertise their products. “Souk Mokhayyamna” is “The Market of Social Cohesion” run by the WPA, where people can connect and communicate. As a volunteer there, I helped with the smooth execution of the event by assisting vendors with the setup of their booths, directing attendees to different areas of the event, and providing support during cleanup and tear-down. This purposeful experience enabled me to promote the economic growth of my community, which left me positive and fulfilled.
     Being one of the youngest members of the Ghassan Kanafani Book Club, I shared my passion for reading with other members of my society. We promoted reading to Palestinian youth and encouraged them to discuss various cultural and social topics during sessions. The library was a great place for me to practice my literary and oral skills when discussing books. I was exposed to various writing styles, which helped me acquire the skill of self-expression through writing.
    Engaging with society enabled me to see my real community, with all its suffering, talents, and potential. It introduced me to new perspectives and values and taught me to be responsible and caring. Life is an everlasting circle of nurturance, we get to live, and we give to let live.

Through volunteering, a person acquires a strong personality and the qualities of a leader that enable him to face any difficult thing in his life.

I volunteered at the Nawat Foundation, and I was a teacher's assistant. We were teaching children who had dropped out of school, especially girls. We were working to enable them to read and write to pursue their dreams, to secure a better future for them, and to educate them about preserving their health. She also participated in many activities with the Ghassan Kanafani Foundation; she participated in the campaign to clean the beach and also in the activity of going to the nursing home and providing food for them. I also participated in an activity with the school that was about raising awareness about how to avoid wasting water in the school and the region, and the activity with the school also included a campaign to clean the beach and the main streets.

At that time I was in a club with my friends who are the same age as me, I used to walk about 15 minutes every day to reach the playground, and sometimes we competed against other clubs in nearby neighborhoods. The priority in the team was teamwork and good communication between that mates to score as many goals in the opposing team's goal as we can.
 Moreover, I was a part of my class soccer team where we participated in the school tournament against other classes and we won the trophy after I scored the decisive penalty kick.

I am also a volunteer at Abnaa Saida, ans we are taking a lot of trainings in SDGs and stuff. I was also an intern at Aquatricity for SDG 6 and 14, as we prepared 100 questions as research interns. I have also been an intern at SAID NGO, in the social media team, which gave me good experience in  both social media algorithms and  colon cancer awareness. I have also gained marketing and pitching skills from both my volunteering and my online page on instagram. I am now a leader and an HR for my podcast under iCademy, with the help of iCademy's HR we are now recruiting new volunteers, and I am managing the team. All of these experiences have made me realise the importance of team work and by that,I am now a very flexible, responsible, and hard-working person. I love being involved in extracurricular activities, achieving success outside our schools is also crucial and being entrepreneurs since we are still in school and under the age of 18 is super needed and I encourage everyone to start their journey as entrepreneurs and leaders at a young age. I am just like every team mate i have at iCademy, and i don't think being a founder of a podcast, writing on my page and my volunteering positions will make me that special out side of my school. But it is the uncontrollable feeling of being special -at least in our finger print- , it is the uncontrollable feeling of knowing that I will for sure, someday leave a print in someone's heart and mind. It is believing that my biological print isn't only biological, and it will reach someone, someday, even if not through this application. But I will for sure be special, not only out side the school, but in every place I might be at.

While my work in Banin is just one aspect of my life outside of school, it has had a profound impact on me, and I am proud to be a part of such an impactful organization.

One of the events that I helped organize was a charity auction. We collected donations from local businesses and individuals, including art pieces, jewelry, and other items, and then auctioned them off to raise money for our cause. It was a challenging but rewarding experience as we worked hard to ensure that the auction was successful and that we were able to raise a significant amount of money.

Another campaign that I was a part of was a food drive. We collected non-perishable food items and distributed them to families in need across Lebanon. Seeing the impact of our work firsthand was incredibly rewarding, and it reminded me of the importance of giving back to our community.

In addition to these events, I also participated in workshops aimed at educating people about the crisis in Lebanon and what they can do to help. These workshops helped me learn more about the situation in my country and allowed me to share that knowledge with others.

Outside of Banin, I am involved in a variety of clubs and activities. I am a member of the school's debate team, where I have developed my public speaking and critical thinking skills. I am also a member of the school's environmental club, where we work to promote sustainable practices and educate others about environmental issues.

Overall, my work in Banin and my involvement in other clubs and activities have helped me develop skills such as leadership, teamwork, and communication.

It really shapes the personality leaving a strong impact on your way of thinking, it just alters your whole perspective towards life. I was blessed to have the ability to volunteer outside my school and experience the joy that comes with the process. I mainly volunteered in a summer camp in Ghadi at Al Irshad w Al Islah in summer, then private tutoring for free in winter. My time at Ghadi's summer camp will never be forgotten. As a volunteer counselor, it was my job to lead a group of kids through sports, games, arts and crafts, and other activities. It was challenging but also exciting because of the children's diverse personalities and backgrounds. I discovered that I was able to connect with each child and have a positive effect on their experience by being understanding, patient, and optimistic. Observing the children acquire new abilities and gain self-assurance throughout the summer was one of the most satisfying aspects of volunteering at the summer camp. One child in particular stands out to me. She was shy and reserved at first, but as she made new friends and tried new things, she became more outgoing and confident. It was a delight to observe her development and growth, and it served as a reminder of the power of volunteering to improve the lives of others. In the colder time of the year, I chose to offer my administrations as a private tutor free of charge. I am consistently delighted in educating and had some experience teaching previously, so I figured it would be an effective method for utilizing my abilities to help other people. I put my services out there online, and I got a lot of calls from students who needed help with math, science, and English. While volunteering at summer camp was rewarding, working as a private tutor was a different experience. I was able to work with each student individually, adapting my approach to their unique requirements and learning styles. It was fulfilling to see my understudies work on their grades and gain trust in their capacities. The significance of giving back to the community was one of the lessons I gained by volunteering at the summer camp and providing private tutoring.

These experiences have allowed me to develop skills and interests outside of my academic pursuits and have shaped me into a more well-rounded individual.

One of the most fulfilling experiences I have had was volunteering at a local animal shelter. I spent several months working with cats and dogs, helping to keep their living spaces clean and comfortable, as well as socializing with them. This experience taught me the importance of giving to those who are less fortunate and the joy that comes from helping others in need.

Another project that holds a special place in my heart is my involvement with a local organization that supports underprivileged youth. I have had the opportunity to participate in various initiatives, such as organizing events, offering tutoring services, and fundraising. This experience allowed me to develop my leadership and communication skills, as well as a deeper understanding and empathy for those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds.

In addition to volunteering, I have also been involved in various clubs and workshops that have allowed me to explore interests outside of my academic studies. I have participated in a debating club, a photography club, and a workshop on personal finance. These experiences have allowed me to meet like-minded individuals, acquire new skills, and broaden my horizons.

In Ibad Alrahman, I volunteered to help sort their library, which is used as a place where people of all ages can come and do their research or just read, or be lent whatever pleases them. The library consists of 5 big rooms, each filled to the brim with books of different types ranging from religious books to science books, there were more than 40,000 books in the library! To keep all of these books organized, so they can be lent the books they want, the library uses an excel and access spreadsheet that has all the books documented and organized using the alphabet, category, and numbers assigned to each book. But they need to check that each book is in its place on the shelves, and that's where the volunteering part kicks. The workers there assign each volunteer a list that is printed from the excel sheet and the volunteer should check that there are no errors on the shelves and in the paper itself and then organize and fix it, after a week after I started my volunteer work I almost organized about 4000 by myself and taught a new volunteer how things work around here. In makassed volunteers, I volunteered in many different activities the first was to organize presents for kids for eid el fetr the other was to help with the setup of the graduation ceremony for the graduating class of 2022 from our school, and another was helping in the summer to set up a daycare for the kids to start attending.

I have participated in several events organized by Ahla Fawda NGO, such as food distribution for families in need and recycling initiatives. These events have allowed me to make a tangible difference in the lives of those around me, and I have been inspired by the positive impact that our efforts have had.

In addition to participating in events, I have also been involved in tutoring. I have helped students who are struggling in certain subjects and have seen firsthand the difference that a little extra help can make in a student's academic performance.

Another way I have been able to give back to my community is by baking cookies and selling them, then donating the profits to families in need. I found that this was a creative and fun way to raise money for a good cause, and it allowed me to combine my passion for baking with my desire to help others.

Lastly, I have also participated in beach clean-up events. I think it is important to protect our environment and the ocean, and I believe it is our duty to keep our beaches clean for everyone to enjoy.

Yes,Female,2021-2022,Yes,No,No,No,Private,Yes,Life Sciences - LS,85.5,82,85,Yes,1 time,"Throughout my school years, I have constantly engaged in community service and extracurricular activities and demonstrated the skills of a socially responsible and aware citizen. Such activities have filled up my soul with positivity and bliss and have also helped me benefit from my free time. I enjoy investing in myself, as I am an extremely curious person always ready to try new stuff and further explore myself. I always aim higher, look further, and don’t settle for the bare minimum, regardless of my previous accomplishments and successes.
Community service and volunteering have always been my top priorities. Since the day I joined the Bqosta Association for Social Development (BASD), I have become extremely inspired to contribute to improving my community in every way possible. Being a member in this organization has also played a major role in developing my communication skills and my drive to provide services to my community. 
We’ve taken part in several events since 2019 including Waste Sorting, Environmental Actions and Activities, Charity Work for the elderly and people in need, COVID 19 Workshops, and many more. Not to mention, I have recently volunteered to call local citizens and offer filling a survey related to the COVID-19 vaccine. I also participated in similar voluntary activities on my own as well as within my school such as being a logistics volunteer member in HHHS MUN 2021, HHHS Debate Competition 2019, and HHHS Poetry Night 2015. 
As for the extracurricular activities, I have always focused on investing in my skills and hobbies and discovering the things I excel in. I’ve taken part in multiple MUN and MAL conferences at LAU as well as two other schools one of which is my school (HHHS). Not only have these conferences helped enhance my research and public speaking skills, but they have also equipped me with the necessary knowledge and experience to tackle serious issues in the world and provide feasible solutions. 
Furthermore, I took part in a very interesting Reading Competition in 2015 whereby participants were asked to read 5 books within one month and write letters to a friend recommending this book in particular. Thankfully, I earned the second place after being evaluated according to the 5 letters and an interview. Additionally, due to the increasing number of youngsters getting manipulated through social media in Lebanon and the world as a whole, I have taken part in a two-day training session conducted by the organization of Himaya to raise awareness on this matter in 2019. 
In addition, I have participated in the RHU Robotics Competition 2020 and won the first place for the High School Track. The mission of the competition was to build and program an autonomous robot which in turn has to overcome many obstacles before it can storm the restricted area.  This competition in particular has inspired me to believe in myself and in my abilities and was one of the motives that triggered me to choose the Mechatronics Engineering program. 
Taking part in such competitions motivated me to participate in the LAU Virtual Summer Camp 2020 (Computing Camp) which boosted my programming skills by practicing Python software. Not only have I joined multiple competitions and conferences throughout my school journey, but I also have been elected as the class representative (2018/2019 and 2020/2021) and as the representative and coordinator of the Eco Friendly Club of my high school. In addition to my responsibilities as the club director, I used to attend local workshops in OLA (Outreach and Leadership Academy) related to environmental actions as a representative to my school.
On another note, despite the limitations that this lockdown has enforced, I made sure to take advantage of my time by refreshing my memory in French through the Duolingo application and developing my French skills, as I crossed many stages since then. 
Besides my previously mentioned accomplishments in the earlier section, I have also taken part in the Lebanese Scouts Association (S1) a couple of years ago which has contributed to boosting my confidence, enhancing my leadership and communication skills and satisfying my community service desire.
Participating in many voluntary events and extracurricular activities has played an essential role in building my character and enhancing my leadership skills. Moreover, such events have introduced me to a variety of new issues and diverse situations of the society and uncovered the selfless version of myself.

That was the case after the explosion that took place in Beirut on August 4th, 2020, the sixth-largest accidental artificial non-nuclear explosion in human history.
My grandpa always used to tell me: “Life is short my son, make use of every moment,” and it wasn't until this experience that I truly took his words to heart. 218 people lost their lives and thousands their beloved ones. It was a reminder of just how fragile and fleeting life can be.
The explosion left many people without their homes, and the government made little effort to address the disaster. As a result, local organizations stepped in to provide aid to those affected by the explosion. I was fortunate enough to have no serious injuries, so I decided to join one of these organizations and offer my help for a few weeks.
During this time, I witnessed firsthand the destruction caused by the explosion. Houses were filled with broken artifacts, shattered family photos, and broken glass. It was like a war zone. As I cleaned up these homes and apartments, I could not help but think about how fortunate I am to have a roof over my head, healthy parents, and food on the table. This experience made me realize the importance of cherishing every moment with my loved ones.
Since working with the organization, I have tried to always look on the bright side and make the most of my time with my family. I have also started to visit my grandmas more often. Most importantly, this experience has helped me become more patient and understanding with my brother, who has autism. I have learned to appreciate his presence and well-being above all else regardless of all his difficulties.
My brother has been a major part of my life ever since his birth, and the challenges he poses have always been tough for me to handle emotionally, psychologically, and academically due to his outbursts and tantrums. However, this experience has made me cherish his presence and appreciate how lucky I am that his difficulties are my biggest challenges in life and not something of higher severity. His presence and indirect affection that he provides occasionally is enough to make me forget all the worries in the world.
This circumstance also led to me becoming more involved in community service events around the country. It showed me how much pleasure doing good for your country and community provides and proved to me that there is so much more to life than materialism. It also taught me to enjoy the little things in life for I might look back one day and realize how big these little things were.
Tomorrow isn’t promised. I might not always get the things I want. But there are always bigger blessings that should never be taken for granted.

Life was never easy for my family. In Lebanon, a woman is not allowed to pass on her identity to her husband and kids, so my brothers and I grew up as refugees. It seems fine from the outside, but a Palestinian in Lebanon is disallowed to from opening his own business, or owning a home, and are considered the gap fillers in public schools. I always had to come up with silly excuses to avoid going out with my friends on trips, like I’m not in the city or the classic; I’m busy studying. 

Despite the tough times in Lebanon, I was always grateful that I was living in a house and being educated. I always had sympathy towards the Syrian refugees who live in tents. When sharing in the Hope humanitarian organization, the scenarios I saw were worse than I had imagined. Barefooted kids were roaming the muddy ground, Families were stranded on the streets, and even the people living in the tent had to pay rent for the landowner! 

Fortunately, the goal of the organization’s visit to Lebanon was to help the refugees. We embarked on a two-hour journey to Bekaa, where the poorest Syrians were, and distributed plenty of food boxes. Then we headed towards a free-of-cost refugee school, where I distributed toys to the kids and saw them happily dance without playing a beat! One man told me that these refugees had been living here for thirty years and still waiting for the promise to become a reality. They were promised for so long that they would live in better conditions.

To sum things up, it turns out I’m not just a goalkeeper! Volunteering helped me realize that I’m stronger than I assumed and made me grateful for my life. Similarly, books taught me empathy and broadened my creativity.

Actually this workshop meant a lot to me because it taught me a lot about real life and it helped me to see how life is totally different from how I thought it is during my school education. This workshop taught me that group work is way better than a solo work, since, when we work in a group, we will be able to discuss a lot of ideas and when we agree on one idea, we’ll work all together, hand by hand, and start developing this idea until it becomes distinctive and effective. However, when someone works alone, his/her information will be limited, so no matter how much he/she try to develop, it they will get to a point where they can do nothing.

It let me meet people from five different countries which are “Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and west bank”.

In this activity, we invited people from outside the school and we have done a short show to show the bad feelings that the Palestinians felt at that time and continues to feel that pain until now.

As I grew older I understood how important these circles are how they're interlinked with one another.
Growing in Lebanon you'd understand that most people here depend on humanitarian initiatives that can ease and assess people's lives. Being raised in such a difficult environment intrigued my sense of belonging to humanity. Not only was I thankful for a lot of people that helped us, but I also learnt at a really young age that if you can't repay someone's goodness make sure you treat others with the same goodness you were treated with. Hence, I decided to not only take from my circles, but give them as well. Our school started an initiative in which I was glad to be part of, where we volunteer with the Red Cross for an entire semester to learn their background, their tasks and their role in society through weekly sessions.
However, my first out school volunteer experience started with a culinary academy in a company called Diet Center for three months, where they teach people with disabilities livelihood skills such as cooking, packaging, and everything related to the food industry to help them be part of the community and left out. I thought it was amazing what they’re doing, because people with disabilities deserve to work and be integrated in society, just as much as we do. Afterwards, with Amel Association international, I volunteered for a month and covered 80 hours of assistance work for the sustainable environment program, where it mainly focused on raising awareness and  teaching vulnerable groups the importance of sustainability, as well as experiencing a healthy lifestyle.

I first entered my school’s MUN club “Hassan Kassir MUN Summer Club” and out of many people, they picked me to participate in the 2017/2018 GCLAUMUN for middle school. It was such a fun and informative experience as I got to know more about worldwide issues. I also participated in the annual BHS MUN conference in middle school as well. 
It was my first experience as a delegate, I didn’t win at first but I left this conference with new skills to offer. I became more confident, knowledgeable, and learned how to become a leader and not someone who controls a bloc. Obviously, I learned how to solve conflict using debate.
 I participated again in 10th grade in the 15th annual high school GCLAUMUN and left with a position paper award, and I was very proud of myself. I also participated in the 2nd HKMUN and won a diplomacy award. In the 3rd HKMUN I became a co-chair for a Futuristic Arctic Cabinet. It was really fun deciding on a new future topic, and watch the delegates debate and looking for answers and solutions for each crisis we stroke. I really love MUN, it was such an amazing experience that I would trade the world for again. 
Moreover, I’m a very humanitarian person. I like to help people. My dad once had a trip to an orphan and disabled peoples’ organization ((??? ???????-????? ????? and spent a day with the kids who live and go there, we spent the day playing games, learning new things, and much more. Moreover, a group of friends and I actually made a fundraiser where we collected money to buy necessary needs for people in need, we also collected clothing items which weren’t needed by their previous owners anymore and donated them to people in need.
 Added to that, two of my friends and I are working on a school project where we would collect e-wastes from students in school and sell them to a company which would extract materials such as aluminum, plastic, copper and much more. Using the money collected, we will try our best to expand and build a cross-walk for disabled people (people in wheelchairs), we’ve also suggested the place we’d have it built in. 
Moreover, I’ve participated in AUB’s 26th Annual Science, Mathematics, and Technology Fair where I got the 3rd prize in “Science-Research” after I discussed the importance of vaccination and the process and types of vaccines against COVID-19 and measure that I would take to encourage people to get vaccinated which was through starting on the small side; I’d send out google forms with the help of the school’s IT system and the school administration of course to know the reasons behind their hesitation ",1,"American University of Beirut (AUB), Lebanese American University (LAU)",No,Married,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,0,No,No,No,552,Eligible,Not Considered,Income Higher,0,TRUE,1,Avg,’ person love public speaking ’ joined model united nation club ’ club since middle school first entered school ’ mun club “ hassan kassir mun summer club ” many people picked participate 20172018 gclaumun middle school fun informative experience got know worldwide issue also participated annual bh mun conference middle school well first experience delegate ’ win first left conference new skill offer became confident knowledgeable learned become leader someone control bloc obviously learned solve conflict using debate participated 10th grade 15th annual high school gclaumun left position paper award proud also participated 2nd hkmun diplomacy award 3rd hkmun became cochair futuristic arctic cabinet really fun deciding new future topic watch delegate debate looking answer solution crisis stroke really love mun amazing experience would trade world moreover ’ humanitarian person like help people dad trip orphan disabled people ’ organization ??? ???????????? ????? spent day kid live go spent day playing game learning new thing much moreover group friend actually made fundraiser collected money buy necessary need people need also collected clothing item ’ needed previous owner anymore donated people need added two friend working school project would collect ewastes student school sell company would extract material aluminum plastic copper much using money collected try best expand build crosswalk disabled people people wheelchair ’ also suggested place ’ built moreover ’ participated aub ’ 26th annual science mathematics technology fair got 3rd prize “ scienceresearch ” discussed importance vaccination process type vaccine covid19 measure would take encourage people get vaccinated starting small side ’ send google form help school ’ system school administration course know reason behind hesitation,0.167496537,Nothing,1,4,2,6,2,0,0,2,1

They are hard to recall because they are a lot, but here are my favourites. 
I started volunteering in middle school to read stories for the unfortunate in Saida's Old Souk at Ola Academy. I also held the same storytelling sessions for kids at a local NGO called ????? ???? ?????? in Sharhabil where I live. I was also the spokesperson for this NGO for 2-3 years and hosted all of their events.

Also during middle school, I formed my own bookclub that is now called ""Everything Book-ish"". It includes more than 20 readers and we used to meet on monthly basis. When Covid-19 happened, we kept our discussions via a Whatsapp groupchat and they've stayed that way ever since. 

During lockdown because of Covid-19, all my storytelling sessions and events were hindered. So, I decided to spread the love for books and reading on my Instagram account. I filmed Books Recommendation Videos that varied each time in the genre and posted them. Surprisingly, they helped a lot of people get into reading and find new books that suit them. 

I have participated and won many reading and writing competitions. My favourite is the one held by Samir Publishing House and The British Council, which was called ???? ??? ???? ???. I won second place and bought books with the prize money. The most recent competition I won was LAU's Summer Writing Program competition, where we had to write a short story in a couple of hours. I won second place and was granted a 20% scholarship at LAU. 

I am forever grateful for my many encounters with people from all ages during these events and competitions outside school. They have helped in forming my personality today and elevated my self-confidence. I have also gained a lot of lovely and beneficial experiences that helped me grow. No matter how hard I study at school, I will always give credit to these activities that I held or participated in outside of school in my free time, for they are worth a hundred A marks.

Thus, being a volunteer in JEEL Sustainable Development, which is an NGO focused on various fields to help people in need, especially in education and assistance for students, has been one of the most pleasing experiences of my life to give a tangible change in the lives of those who require it.

To start, when I joined JEEL Sustainable Development, I was given the task to provide young orphans with new shoes, clothes, and even toys to celebrate the Eid holiday. This was part of an event launched for the fifth time by the organization called “Souk 3a Al-Souk” where several volunteers, including myself, helped to draw smiles on the faces of children. As we planned ahead and distributed our rules, I had to take on specific responsibilities and use my skills to monitor that each child had fairly his or her own share. Thus, being able to make a difference gave me the satisfaction of contributing more to our society. 

I was also responsible for organizing school supplies for students. This included things like pens, pencils, sharpeners, copy books and files which were all packed into more than 100 various school bags. These backs were then distributed to schools, especially to students in elementary and middle school. Being part of the process was a fulfilling experience since it is vital to help children access the vital tools that they need to have a proper education. This experience not only allowed me to help children access crucial tools they need to succeed in school but also gave me a sense of satisfaction to provide the need for their resources.
One of the most inspiring moments of my volunteering experience came when I had the opportunity to listen to JEEL’s guest, Mr. Imraan Choonara when the new office of JEEL opened in Chehim. He spoke about his journey and plans for the future with ultimate inspiration and had me reinforce my belief in the importance of volunteer work, especially for youth.

This is why I try to participate in as many charities as I can manage. One that particularly stuck with me is a relief organization ""????? ???? ??????? ??? ?? ??? ??????"" where we gave food, drink, clothing, and shelter to any who needed it. What specifically stuck with me though was the face of this little boy during an event organized for eid. This boy was unsure and a bit untrusting of everyone around him. It was evident he didn't have the best lot in life. During this event, we gave adults some money and basic supplies but we gave kids things that would spark joy in their hearts such as toys or candy, things that their parents would deem luxury in hard times and not buy. I was walking between the kids and handing out gifts when I noticed the boy hanging back unsure of his reception. I could tell life hadn't been kind to this sweet little boy. So, I approached him with a bag of candy and a toy truck. At first, he declined the gifts, but with some persuasion, he took them. The glimmer in his eyes and his wide toothy smile while he endlessly thanked me and went to tell his parents will never leave my mind. It hurts my heart to see my beautiful community hurting which is why after  August 4, 2020 port explosion, I rushed to join the Makassed school's organization. We went to the neighborhoods and helped clean up debris in addition to handing out any needed supplies. My devotion to bettering my community was also one of the leading motives for my project at my school's STEAM science fair. My friends and I made a remote control solar-powered toy car. This project aimed to tackle a more direct cause of pollution, lithium battery pollution. We explained our idea to several professors from different universities and schools and thus secured our first-place prize.

I have participated in a variety of events, campaigns and workshops. One of my earliest experiences with volunteerism was in grade 6 when my school organized a reforestation event on Mount Kneisseh. We planted various trees, including cedars, and it was an incredibly rewarding experience that sparked my passion for volunteerism. 
   After the traumatic explosion of the port of Beirut in 2020, I was eager to help in any way I could and joined the “Ahl w Habayeb” association, where I helped to clean the streets of the debris caused by the explosion. When the pandemic hit, many volunteer activities were put on hold, but I didn’t let that stop me. In early 2021, I resumed my volunteer work with the “Ahl w Habayeb” association, this time focusing on taking care of the elderly. 
   I continued my volunteer journey with the Lebanese Red Cross – Youth sector, followed by “Binaa Ajyal Al-Salam” association, which I joined in the first quarter of 2022. In my third year of secondary school, I joined an English Club with my schoolmates, where we organized events in coordination with the school administration. One of the events we organized was a Breast Cancer Awareness Day, where experts in the field and cancer survivors visited our school and shared their experiences. We also organized a day focused on common psychological issues faced by teenagers, where a psychologist gave a lecture on the importance of mental health and ways of coping.
    Lastly, in the same academic year, I was a part of organizing a Global Village themed day at our high school, an event we organized for the purpose of getting to know other cultures and demonstrating the uniqueness variety beholds. On that day, each class presented a certain culture through its cuisine and traditions. Unfortunately, due to the school lockout, we were not able to organize any more events. However, during the lockout, I have been attending online workshops with Life Sculptor regarding Bipolar Disorder, Decision Making, Computer Science and Engineering & Gene Editing.

It was like a light bulb moment as I looked back on the past two years of my life. I realized that my volunteering efforts, from organizing campaigns and workshops to participating in clubs and events, had given me a profound sense of fulfillment and joy. Helping others had become my passion, and it was what set me apart from my peers.

But it wasn't just about doing good deeds. I was fortunate enough to have many opportunities to participate in academic and extracurricular activities that helped me grow both personally and academically. For example, I was thrilled to win the Trustees of the purposes of the scientific exhibition at the Makassed annual science fair and take part in the Beirut Arab University and American University Of Beirut science fairs. I received certificates of honor and excellence for my outstanding performance at school and participated in the Lebanese American University Model Arab League, where I developed my leadership and public speaking skills.

These experiences, along with many others, have allowed me to make a difference in my community while also honing my personal and academic skills. Whether it was raising awareness about abuse and assault or tutoring struggling students, I was able to contribute to my community in meaningful ways. I've also had the opportunity to organize and volunteer at school events, take care of kids during school events, and give presentations to raise awareness about important issues.

One of the most impactful projects I worked on was the ""Stronger by Choice"" initiative, which aimed to raise awareness about breast cancer. Through organizing school events, working with NGOs, and creating podcasts, I was able to help breast cancer survivors and provide hope and support to those affected by the disease.

Moreover, volunteering has allowed me to develop empathy, compassion, and a deep appreciation for the power of collective action to effect positive change.  Whether it's organizing events, raising awareness about important issues, or helping students with their studies, every act of service has the potential to make a meaningful impact in someone's life. Through  volunteering , I have learned that even the smallest gestures of kindness can make a big difference in the world.
 In conclusion, my passion for serving others has been the driving force behind my extracurricular activities and accomplishments over the past two years. Through my participation in various initiatives, events, and clubs, I have been able to make a positive impact in my community while also developing my personal and academic skills.

Yes,Female,2023-2024,Yes,No,No,Yes,UNRWA,No,Life Sciences - LS,89.92,84.6875,87.5,Yes,1 time," I would like to share with you a chapter of my book that changed my life and created an outstanding version of me because I learned a lot of things from this experience.
   
     When I was just 10 years old, I was in the gymnastics class, and I hurt my back so badly. So, I went to the hospital, and the doctor said that my back is pressed on and my vertebral column takes the C shape. The cure was to attend physiological sessions, but I didn't.. because we couldn't afford that. So I opened YouTube videos for ""scoliosis"" treatment, and I learned a lot. After 7 months of self treatment, commitment and determination, I felt that I'm finally OK. I went to the doctor and he was surprised that I had made this progress by myself. Time passed, and I heard that my neighbour had a similar case to ""scoliosis,"" so I offered to help her. After only 5 months of helping her fix her back, it was getting better and she no longer felt pain. All that and I were only about 10 years old.

    After I've spent 4 years of practicing gymnastics, my coach found out that I'm good enough to coach, so I started as an assistant for him then he held me his position as a coach when he was busy or travelling, then he asked me to coach new students that some of them have mental and psychological problems, until I have my own gymnastics class when I was 13 years old. I get my own salary, use only my own money, help my family and buy new books. Moreover, because I have excellent academic knowledge, I started to teach my neighbours' children. And now, they are all excellent and brilliant students. 

    In short, this chapter taught me to let myself stand by its own, to solve my own problems, to work on myself in order to expand my knowledge and abilties and exploit them in helping people and stand by my own financially. I learned to be independent, responsible, to have leadership and communication skills, to deal with people having mental or psychological problems and help them to get better and a lot of other skills that make my personality much stronger, wiser and more responsible.

     To add, I participated in many sport shows and competitions and I always did great performance. I also participated in a computer training program for like 5 months and succeeded in all the tests. Concerning volunteering activities, I volunteered in many school activities like cleaning the beach, painting the walls of our camp, planting trees, visiting kids with special needs and support them. I also participated twice in a campaign to distribute supplies for Ramadan.

     I think that rarely do people at my age at that time think and set goals like I did. Most people at 10, or even older, only think of their academic life. But from my own perspective, I think that this age is the beginning to build up yourself and find your hobby outside school settings or contributing to our community. And if someone tells me to give a message to parents, I would like to advise them to allow their children to cross the threshold of school and let them open up to society from a young age and teach them to balance between school achievements and practicing their hobbies and that contributing to community is a must, so they would grow up taking their society into consideration and not only their own lifes. No one knows. Maybe the chaniging point to be in a developed community starts from here. And concerning their own good, maybe they will make something great from mastering their hobbies. And this will never affect their academic performance because here I am, I have excellent grades and I'm working about 5 hours a day. It's not a big deal.

It is an organization which works on empowering children through sports while giving equal opportunities to both males and females. We used to have basketball practices twice a week. Each practice was full of teamwork, competition and a lot of fun. At the end of summer, we used to compete against other teams of PACES from different cities in the presence of professional basketball players and trainers. Members who won these competitions got the opportunity to represent PACES in Norway. We had dinners during Ramadan and festivals during Eid as a team. I also participated in Al Jarrah Scouts in which we used to do all sorts of activities. We organised festivals, in some we celebrated Eid with kids, and in others we celebrated mother’s day. It was wonderful to put a smile on other people’s faces. We used to have campaigns, such as cleaning days and awareness booths, to make the environment around us better. During Ramadan, we made food and gave them to those in need. This made me love helping people and start giving to others without expecting something in return. We visited nursing homes on mother’s day to make all the mothers there feel happy and appreciated. The most enjoyable part about the Scouts was camping. We used to go to Ammiq and camp there for many days. Staying away from home helped me learn survival skills, and be more independent. It also helped me bond with others, and make good memories filled with songs and laughter. Due to the Covid pandemic, I could not participate in other activities in the past three years, but this summer I am planning on volunteering in Helwa Ya Baladi, a local organization that aspires to promote society at a social, educational and cultural level.

It is giving a person 's time and ability to help someone who may be in need of help. Not only does volunteering help others, but what they may not know is that it can be helpful to themselves. It is a great way for someone to interact with others in their community. It gives someone that time to themselves while also creating bonds when they are doing the greater good. The effects of volunteering can range from many helpful characteristics. From helping those in need, giving back to the community, working for worthwhile causes, and overall helping someone with their health, mentally and physically.
When I am a member of Access 15 I organized a good health project with 3 of my friends .It was about viruses . So we chose 2 viruses the first is Influenza which spreads a lot but it is not dangerous, and the second is AIDS which not spread much but it is very dangerous . So as a first step we made a whats App group and sent a pre-survey to the students  to find out how well people know about them. After that, we did a presentation at school and then we did a small activity, which was drawing the AIDS logo and coloring it with the students fingerprints, and finally we made a post survey . Our goal was to educate people about this types of viruses in Lebanon, precautions, and others information. So when we did the survey we clearly saw the results . The students before did not know much about these viruses especially AIDS but after the presentation, they became aware of a lot of information. They also benefited from the activity and had a great time. We all worked together to achieve our goals and made our project interesting, important, and useful. 
Last Summer I organized a rise project in a school near my house.It  was about bullying in schools,it is a community service project . I choosed bullying because it is an important issues ,it's an action in ways that scare or harm another person . it is a serious problem for all children involved . To implement my project , I visited a school next to my house and i choosed a specific number of target .i make a poster shows definition of bullying , help for victims , story about bullying , and anti-bullying training . My project was very effective and benefit . the duration was 1 mouth.
I am also a member of a scout organization that organizes many projects in my village and I mention some of these events and projects : Blood donation campaign, small Christmas party themed ""Celebrate and be many "",making food for the army in their day, distributing wheat to the people of the village on the Barbara feast, clean the church, a small festival called "" share the spirit "" ,making fun activities to the children ,and making recreational camps for the young
This activities can make me happy and really enjoyed and I very like when I see others people happy . Every Human being is born Unique and special. A human becomes unique when they find their own strengths and capabilities. Being special is what makes an individual different than others. People can be special based on their talent, personality, achievements, qualities etc. I feel that I am different than other in many ways. The most important thing that makes me unique is my personality , every success and downfall experiences both good and bad, the knowledge we acquire and observations we make all mold us into the person we become this thing make everyone unique . Other thing is creativity, passion and innovative ways so I really enjoy learning new things and constantly seeking out new learning opportunities and provide me with unique technical skills  . I have leadership skills which enables me to organize projects.And  I am a very good communicator and find it's easy for me to relate to other people.

As volunteers in the Jill Association for Sustainable Development, we used to spend about 7 hours a day only allocating winter clothes for children in the camps and orphans who live in the places of frost. These hours were one of the most valuable moments of my life. With a few hours of my time I helped ensure warmth for children living in remote tents, cramped camps or even alone without a family.Your giving is their warmth a humanitarian campaign? Social media platforms fought to be a tranquility for thousands of refugees and the most needy in Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, infilrating the feelings of millions to unite those feelings towards human warmth.This campaign was able to reach 40, 000 smiles, success and excellence in charity to serve more than 10, 000 families from the less fortunate
Yes, i was apart of this wonderful success.
Note:
For reasons related to the deteriorating political situation in Lebanon: October 17 revolution and   Covid-19 storm that swept the country and closed the doors of recreational, voluntary and even professional stations, in addition to the academic pressure. I was not able to do many activities, so I volunteered as many hours as I could, and will do so in the near future.
What makes me special in my activities outside of school is that I have a conscience that guides and controls my actions and efforts.For example:When I want to do any work, I give all my energy, abilities and accuracy in order to be unique and creative in what I do.I am a person who loves to carry out his tasks and goals without any shortage.And when I insist on achieving something, I am that perfect person;who respects time in an exaggerated way, organizes the stages in which he wants to achieve his activity;He respects and appreciates everyone around him.What distinguishes me from others is also my healthy and sound interaction with members of society.I am a very peaceful person who does not like to create problems and I always look for safety and reassurance for myself and the love of others for me.
When I do something I do in silence, I do not like to draw attention, but as they say, do not be afraid of the raging sea, but be afraid of the calm sea, since for my silence always amazing results that is unexpected.

I have also done a-lot of volunteering in helping keep this community clean and pollution free by cleaning streets and beaches.

My desire to volunteer may consume my time, but the countless rewards I receive from volunteering are priceless. Offering my time to organizations has allowed me to become more humble, see the happiness it brings to people, and improve my social skills.

Volunteering and participating in various projects and events have always been a significant part of my life. Among the many volunteering experiences, the best and most memorable one was being a member of ""The Hussein Organization."" This organization aimed to help the poor by providing them with food, clothes, and other basic necessities. Even participating in several activities and lessons that help raise ethical children and teach them how to preserve and aid their country. I was fortunate in being a part of this organization, and it was and still a life-changing experience for me, in which I am still to this day a participant in this organization volunteering and acting on the ground with them and a member of the ethical, informative, and athletic lessons and activities that they do daily and weekly.

I have been a part of this organization since nearly 7 years and during this time, we organized several events to feed the poor and bring them clothes. We would collect donations from people and buy food, clothes, and other necessities to distribute among the less fortunate. One of the most challenging events we organized was during the winter season, where we provided warm clothes and blankets to the homeless people who had no shelter to protect them from the harsh weather. Witnessing their smile and gratitude made my day and motivated me to keep doing more to help them.

Apart from being a part of the ""The Hussein Organization,"" I have also participated in a first aid event, where I learned about basic first aid techniques. The event was organized by an incredible organization (??????? ?????? ?????????) with professional staff and medical technicians that aimed to spread awareness about emergency response and first aid. I was excited to be a part of the event as it was a chance for me to learn something new and to help others.

The event included workshops on various first aid techniques, and I was amazed to learn how a few basic steps could save someone's life in an emergency. The instructors were knowledgeable and experienced, and they taught us how to handle different situations like cuts, burns, and even cardiac arrests. Besides, we learned how to do some professional techniques like CPR, RES, AND PLS. The practical sessions were the most informative, where we got to apply the techniques we learned on dummies.

In a nut shell, volunteering and participating in various projects and events have been a significant part of my life. Being a member of ""The Hussein Organization"" and participating in the first aid event have been the most memorable experiences for me. These experiences have taught me the importance of helping others and how even small actions can make a significant impact on someone's life. I believe these experiences make me special outside my school work, and I hope to continue volunteering and participating in various and plenty more events in the future.

But what people don’t know is that it can be helpful to themselves, not only to others. To me, volunteering in campaigns and projects was a great way to interact with others in our community, it also gave me that time to myself while creating bounds while I am doing the greater good. From helping those in need, giving back to the community, working for worthwhile causes, and other all helping someone with their health, mentally and physically, these qualities were all instilled in me just for having the well to help our surrounding life. 
Every year at school, we always have a piggy bank in class where we start to collect money. When the piggy bank is full, so full it’s about to burst actually, and when schedule is not busy, we and our Arabic language teacher use the money to do our volunteering work, which is supporting the poor people. It’s one of two: either we buy food from the charity kitchen called “ El Kheir Restaurant”, or we go there and serve the food for these who are in need. This is now happening this year and we, as a class always feel happy with such a beautiful event. I have done the same thing last year, but it was in the holy month of Ramdan and in the same charity place, where I also gave the ones in need fresh food. When we finish such event, we always clean the place while thinking back at how nice it was putting a smile on their faces. I have also done something similar with my parents. Every while, we would g tetra food supplies and grains some people might need, and we would distribute them in my school, to the housekeepers or school guards for example, and it always gives me a warm feeling when the life and joy comes back to these people faces. Such a thing provides me with a sneak peek of my future, especially since helping people in need is the top priority for me as a psychologist.

What makes me special when it comes to such work, is that I am a kind hearted person, and a passionate young one, with a love for being of aid for all types of people.

As a result, I always look out to help my society in any way possible. This is why I joined multiple 
volunteering projects and campaigns to aid the place which I live in. 
One of the most prominent volunteering service that I joined is one conducted by our physics 
teacher Ahmad Al-Sayyed. It was a project where I and many of my friends in class made sure that 
my school and its classes where eco friendly and clean. We also delivered some pins to each 
classroom and started lecturing our fellow students about the importance of keeping our class clean. 
We were very serious and passionate about this project that we started going weekly to our schools 
to dispose of the trash cans and tried to recycle as much material as we could for better uses. It was 
called the “re-use it campaign” and I was very lucky to be an efficient member in its recycling club.
Another project that I joined is the “Breath Green Campaign”. Another project I did with my 
classmate that centred around keeping our environment clean. This time, it focused on the aquatics 
side of our society. It was a campaign where we tried to clean up our local community Nahr el-Bared 
Camp especially at the sea sides and main roads. Additionally, we engaged in water conservation 
projects by viral campaigns where we raised awareness about the importance of reducing the excess 
of the water they each one uses daily, especially in our school and community. Our lake is a big part 
of our society, so I was very proud to participate in a campaign that tried to keep it clean.
Moreover, I participated in a campaign called “NUWAT ASSOCIATE SOCIAL SOLIDARITY CENTRE"". In 
this I volunteered for 60 hours in “NUAT"" as a teacher to assist and help the students. It was a lot of 
fun and I was very happy to know that I had a hand in building the future generations. It was a 
project was very glad and proud to participate in.
Finally, since I love electronics so much, I decided to enter a program called “Robotics Training 
Program” to develop my knowledge in the technological field. It was about robotic training where I 
learned about arduino and programming language (c++). This was very fun and important to me

Being a part of something helps to define who you are as a person and the principles and values you hold as important. A personal experience that helps to show my talents and skills can be illustrated by being a scout girl. Since elementary school, I have been in Mashari^ Girls Scouts Association.  A scout law says, ""A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.” Following and implementing this law I have volunteered and participated in numerous social work, projects, events, and workshops.
    Ever since I was a kid I always had a will to make a difference in the surrounding environment. Through being a scout girl, I am approaching my goal. I clean beaches and streets, plant wide spaces with trees and plants, and visit patients in hospitals. In EID occasions, we distribute candies and sweets for passers-by and toys for kids. In Ramadan, we hold iftar for boys and girls and cook them delicious food. In addition to that, I am a scout drummer. I walked in several marches in different cities for different occasions. In the last 2 years, I attended with my scout buddies various workshops such as the first aid and social media workshops. In some scouts’ parties and festivals, I was the host. For social work I was given a participation certificate that boosts my determination and persistence.
Moreover, in t 2020 and 2021 when the school was online I tried to develop my skills in using the computer and especially in the Microsoft apps. I volunteered at the Association of Islamic Charitable Projects in collecting specific statistics and inserting them on the computer using Microsoft Excel. Furthermore, I volunteered in every summer camps this organization has arranged in the past 3 years. They are based on educational, cultural and entertaining program. I have worked in all of these domains in addition to the administrative section through collecting information about the children. 
     Moreover, I worked as a private teacher for my cousins for free, and I was a babysitter for their siblings. Additionally, When I was in grade 9 I participated in dictation and composition contest; I won the fifth place on Lebanon.

I have also attended conversation classes there in which I developed my social and communication skills. 

With the aim of enriching my knowledge in several fields, I attended a programming course that discusses the fundamentals of python. Knowing that python is one of the most used programming languages around the globe, I am pleased that I in have learned it. Moreover, I have attended several workshops and webinars in order to widen my horizon in several domains. These workshops and webinars include the following: Medical First Aid, Basics of Online Research, Artificial Intelligence, Digital Currencies, Self Love, and Scarce Waters and Amperes Workshop. 

In an attempt of improving my classmates’ academic scores, I created a peer-tutoring program in which I provided students with educational assistance. Consequently, I have constantly spent several hours teaching students math, biology, physics, and chemistry. This activity was of great benefit to the students at my school and for me since I developed teaching and leadership skills.

I have volunteered as a monitor of online workshops and courses with the Fly & Glow Club of iCademy. This club is mainly concerned with educating teenagers about nutrition and skincare. This club constantly provides students with free online educational courses; my role is to organize the sessions, take attendance, and supervise all that relates to the course.

Plus, I was a competitive in various competitions like reading, mathematics and science fairs. I presented my school in different occasions outside. Moreover, I was a member in a team for visiting elderly people, reforestation, beach cleaning and painting streets as a part of our project.

All the above participations make me special, confident, satisfied, productive, understanding and let me gain what school couldn't. I believe that school accomplishments are necessary, but insufficient all the time. A person will be complete when he combines his studies with his personality and community. Most of the students think that they own everything just for being the top in their classes, they lack the sense of confidence, mercy, community belonging and standing upright through the hardest times, that's what makes me distinguished between them. I believe that my personality outside the school is as important as inside it.
I always try to get into my community more and more, know their needs, try to help them as possible as I can and put my future-building plans according to what I observe. All the times I'm working hard and wiling to raise the logo of ""HAND BY HAND, WE CAN AND WE WILL.""

I’ve also taken part in many workshops to broaden my skill set and improve my employability.


As a basketball coach, I organized and led practices, coached games, and mentored young athletes. I gained knowledge about how to develop team morale, motivate athletes to perform to their maximum ability, and interact with players and parents efficiently through this experience. Similarly to this, my experience working as a teacher’s assistant taught me to be tolerant, orderly, and skilled in speaking clearly to both adults and children. I supported the classroom teacher with tasks such as grading assignments and assisting with classroom management.
Alongside my volunteer work, I have concentrated on technology workshops in addition to my voluntary work to increase my knowledge of Microsoft’s offerings and programming languages like Python. These classes gave me a solid foundation in coding and taught me the basics of Python. In addition, I discovered how coding developed into the potent instrument that it is today. My understanding of how technology has changed industries and how it can affect our world going forward has improved significantly as a result of this information.

As important as technical skills are, soft skills are equally crucial. Any scenario requires excellent communication, and by learning techniques for active listening, handling conflict, and public speaking, I have been able to improve my communication skills. Additionally, I have taken part in courses on cultural sensitivity and diversity, which have helped me recognize and value people from different backgrounds. This has helped me encourage a sense of community and establish a secure environment where everyone can express themselves.
The capacity to understand, identify, and control one’s own emotions as well as those of others and those of others’ views is referred to as emotional intelligence. I have acquired techniques for controlling stress, fostering resilience, and cultivating empathy through my volunteer work and training, enabling me to become more emotionally savvy. These abilities have helped me both personally and professionally.
Lastly, time management is a critical ability for everyone, but it’s more important for people with busy schedules. I’ve learned methods for prioritizing chores, dividing big projects into smaller, more manageable chunks, and reducing distractions. These abilities have improved my work output and effectiveness while also enabling me to maintain a healthy work-life balance.


Overall, I’ve been able to advance both professionally and personally through my volunteer work and attendance at numerous programs. Time management, emotional intelligence, effective communication, diversity and inclusivity, and teamwork are all examples of crucial soft skills that have improved my effectiveness in both my volunteer work and my professional life.

I have always been interested in exploring my interests outside of the classroom, and joining various clubs and organizations has allowed me to do just that. These activities can take place before or after school, on weekends, or during school breaks. 
To begin with, I joined several activities after my school throughout the years. The Al Reyaa NGO was one of my activities I contributed in since 2021. The volunteer team and I were so dedicated where we participated in buying Eid outfit for orphans and people in need, planning and participating in entertainment activities for children, and distributed food parcels in different schools and residential neighborhoods in Saida. In addition, I participated in the Alwan program with my school for two years. This program aims to foster the concept of inclusive and active citizenship; it is inclusive of the Lebanese religious diversity and active through experiencing and living together by implementing inter-club community service’s projects. We prepared a room for the mental health in one of the public schools in Hasbaya. I also volunteered in preparing vegetables for large amount of food with my GS peers for 4 days. Other activities I did after school are the programs that I attended with LAU such as Power of Creativity, Power of Optimization, Power of Leadership, Power of Financial Intelligence, Power of Emotional Intelligence, and Power of Social Media.
	Furthermore, I participated in Scouts in the weekends since 2015. The Lebanese Scout Association is an organization that focuses on character development, leadership skills, and community involvement for young people. Through activities such as camping, hiking, and service projects, scouting encourages me to develop my skills such as teamwork, responsibility, and respect for others. Scouting also offers opportunities for us to give back to our communities through volunteer work, fundraising, and service projects. For example, we raised awareness in Bramieh about recycling, cleaned the beach, and participated in events for Ramadan and Mother’s Day. 
	Last but not least, school breaks such as recesses and summer breaks were also full of extra-curricular activities. For instance, I participated in school clubs such as the Mental Health Awareness Club and Clothes for a Cause. In the summer, I was a coach in Sayfona Tasaly summer camp. I had the opportunity to lead a group of girls between the ages seven and nine.  Coaching at a colonie helped me develop the ability to adapt to changing circumstances and think on the spot. 
	In conclusion, participating in extracurricular activities brought numerous benefits to me. These activities provide opportunities to develop my skills beyond academic learning, such as leadership, teamwork, time management, and problem-solving. I also explored my interests and passions, and discovered new hobbies. Overall, involvement in extracurricular activities can broaden one's horizons, improve personal development, and enhance future opportunities.

One of the most reward experiences I have had was volunteering at an orphanage. That day, I contributed in basic tasks done at the orphanage such as cleaning, cooking, and taking care of the orphans. Also, I helped them with their assignments and taught them some english lessons. To add, we played games together, read stories, and watch movies. But the most important point was providing these kids with the emotional support they lack.

Another memorable experience I have had was organizing a clean up campaign. This is the most efficient way to preserve our environment and keep it  healthy and clean. The goal of this campaign was to raise awareness by increasing the recycling rates. For instance, our focus was on reducing the amount of trash and debris that accumulates on our beach. Furthermore, we set regulations to help protect the beach from further damage by banning certain activities on the beach.

Last but not least, I helped my class in organizing a bake sale at our school. First, we decided on the type of baked goods we will be selling and everyone brought a certain type. Next, we put the price on every type and set up the bake sale in the school playground. After the bake sale was over, we counted the money and donated it to an organization that helps poor people.

  Volunteering gives you an opportunity to change people's lives, including your own.

Nevertheless, this did not prevent those with a pure and generous heart from providing assistance under these circumstances. I have the honor to say that I was one of the volunteers in the cholera campaign that took place in Wadi Al-Zeineh , where we conducted awareness sessions about the dangers of Cholera, prevention methods and possible treatments if infection is confirmed.
     In terms of workshops, I can say that I have participated in most of the workshops that are given in our center some of which are : LIFE SKILLS , MIT , ROBOTICS , APP DEVELOPMENT , WEB DEVELOPMENT , DIGITAL LITERACY , EMPLOY ABILITY , ENTREPRENEURSHIP , COOKING , ENGLISH COURSES , CAREER GUIDANCE , PUPPET PLAYING , CHEF WORKSHOP and many other workshops outside the center including First Aid and ENGLISH SPEAKING .

One of my most meaningful experiences was volunteering at fekr w ensan organization. . I spent several hours each week volunteering . When I first took part in it as a volunteer, the staff committee was trying to abate plastic usage in everyday lives. I did my research unswervingly and discussed the findings with the volunteer coordinator who approved my request to host a two-day awareness campaign in the local common building event for people of and nearby our area. I worked with the staff and my fellow volunteers to plan activities .
Volunteering activities like these have spared me the privilege to work with people of diverse age groups, socioeconomic upbringings, or expertise levels, to pitch in to serve as an integrated unit in order to attain a communal goal, and encouraged me to comprehend the bright spots and unseen opportunities in a grim state of affairs. I now know what it takes to lead with empathy and endurance and to inspire others to go the extra mile. I have also learned that through giving, you wind up receiving more in the end. Community service overall has helped me develop as a person which is why I always try to step up as a leader or lend a helping hand whenever possible

I have also been involved in several environmental campaigns and events. I organized a beach cleanup event with my friends and classmates, where we spent a day picking up litter and educating beachgoers about the importance of keeping our oceans clean. 

In addition to my volunteering and activism, I have also been involved in several clubs and workshops. I was a member of my school's robotics workshop, where I learned how to design and program robots, and we design a project and particiapted in the annual robotics exhibition for schools..

When I was 16, I joined a campaign called YMDA - Youth in Municipalities, Democracy in Action. Our main goal was to legislate a law that enforces the founding of youth councils in municipalities. After working in said campaign for a few months, with the help of some research, I was able to write the bylaws we worked by. I was voted to be the head of Public Relations by the other members of the campaign. I was able to use my negotiation and communication skills with the purpose of advocating for the contribution of women and youth in politics. 

During that same year, I joined an online club called MUNC to give students free debate sessions, as I had won several debate awards. But I didn't stop there, I worked hard on a department called the ""Literacy Circle"" as I am very interested in literature, in this department, we hosted a book club and writing sessions.

So the term “servant-leadership” indicates how a leader can have an approach to serve others, focusing on their needs before considering on one’s needs. Our community grows through forming teams and groups in every aspect of our lives, we can’t prosper if everyone works on his/her own. That’s why having a leader who acknowledge other people's opinions, support them to meet their work and personal goals, involve them in decisions where appropriate, and build a sense of community within the team is the key to achieve the success we are looking for to grow our communities. Having a servant leader in each group would definitely lead to higher engagement of all the members meaning that we can benefit from every person’s abilities, more trust, and stronger relationships within the team members.

For several years I have been trying to introduce volunteering into my continuous practice, but without any success. The only connection with volunteering was on several occasions at my school or in my community. But last year a great change happened, I decided to take things in hand and regularly volunteer. I applied to volunteer at Al Jalil Association and I have accepted. I have been volunteering at this association since February 2022. My responsibilities are doing psychosocial activities with children and help in desk services with Al Jalil Association beneficiaries.
Two years ago, during the summer vacation, I started working at a cosmetics shop without getting salary. Cosmetics and makeup is something I’m interested in so I found it a great experience to know more about this world and also it’s a chance for me to be enrolled in the community and to be more social. Although it was the first time for me to work with customers and interact with people, it was very successful and I have learned a lot from it. 
Every year, a group of volunteering boys and girls carry out fundraising campaigns in which foodstuffs are given to poor people and I’m a part of these campaigns; we buy food needs from the collected money and give them to the needed people in our community.
Also, I’m very active my school. In every occasion I should participate, we usually, my friends and I, make entertaining and encouraging activities for students. Few weeks ago, we planned for a funny day in which we performed sport activities, competitions, religious activities because of Ramadan and a lot of other activities.

3- Volunteering at a medical center: For the better art of a decade I wanted to be a doctor. I volunteered at al shifa'a medical center to learn more about the medical field. I was an emergency medic, social worker, and logistics personnel.

4-First Aid Workshop: To further the knowledge I got during my time at al shifa'a, I registered at a workshop organized by the Islamic Palestinian students' Association about first aid.

When I graduated gr9 during quarantine days in 2020, I thought that we’d finally get back to the good old days. I was obviously wrong. Once I started high school, we faced malnutrition. My parents wanted to provide us with the best schools they can afford even if it meant they’d barely end the month with a few cents. They believed in us, knew we had the potential, and that spark that lightens our eyes when it comes to success. Due to sharp malnutrition, I faced high iron deficiency and I extremely feared the consequences. I then sat by myself and wondered: What is it that’s going to make me continue with that jeopardy? I was then left with two options: You either stay down and accept your destiny or you turn those weaknesses into incentives for your empowerment! I can still remember I stayed up day and night barely getting any sleep for I wanted to achieve the best I can. I fought through hardships, tears, the underestimation of others, and pain. And at moments when I thought I’d mess up, I’d recall why I started, turn my dream of being a doctor into a habit, and be extremely sick with average. I would remember that girl’s words and put it as my very first priority slogan: “You can’t wait until life isn’t hard anymore to decide to be happy and achieve your dream.” At that time in gr10, I participated in three MUNs (HHHSMUN, LAUMUN, and HARMUN). However, people started complaining to avoid over-participating in events, thinking that it would be to no avail. But, here I am today fellows. After losing three times in a row in MUN and barely getting high grades, I assure you that I won six MUNs (HARMUN21, HHHSMUN21, LEBMUN22, LAUMUN’22 with a 25% scholarship, HARMUN’22, and the third rank worldwide in IZMIR MUN that held delegates participating from 140 different countries). Not only that but I was able to score top 1 in gr10 with a score of 95.55%, achieve excellence in gr 11 scientific with a score of 91.35%, participate in school activities by posting videos of my public speaking on the school’s official page, host school events with being the main speaker, win the first rank worldwide in the microbiology event that was held by Labroots, attend worldwide workshops and webinars hosted by universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard, and organizations like LABROOTS mainly (ELTOC Chapter 3 Block 4 at Oxford, Toxicology Practice Findings at Labroots, Key factors of Public Presentation And Writing Skills at Cambridge and Managing Mental Health in the Workplace and Racism at Harvard),  participate in community service through the consultant of our school, and finish online first aid and other health courses at both Coursera and Edweb. I truly believe the most important factor why I should receive the scholarship is my passion and commitment. Anyone can be a great writer and anyone can get excellent grades with hard work.

For me, the events that I have participated in throughout the years have had a significant impact on me; such as critical thinking, improved social skills, unlocking a new perspective, and many other benefits.
   One of the events that I have participated in was the Model Arab League (MAL). The Model Arab League is a competition in which high school and university students from across the world learn about and compete as representatives from Arab countries. It was my first time participating in such an event; not to mention also that I was in middle school back then, so I was the youngest participant who was going to be there. However, after doing some research and practicing on doing some speeches and reading them; I was able to gain confidence and eventually be ready for the event. I ended up doing really great, and my hard work didn’t betray me as I won the Honourable Mention Award. Aside from winning this certificate, this event was an important factor that helped in boosting my confidence, achieving personal growth, and stepping out of my comfort zone. 
    Another event that I have participated in was robotics. Personally, I liked this event more than the MAL event, because it required critical thinking for programming a car robot that had some missions that must be accomplished. We were supposed to build the car robot from lego and then program it to follow a black line till the finish; it was called line tracking. This event improved my critical thinking and problem solving skills; where I was able to break down complex problems into smaller tasks as well as developing a logical and methodical approach.
   I also had the chance to participate in a volunteering activity last Ramadan. This activity required getting food and packing them for the poor who had nothing to eat after fasting.

I choose to enroll in such activities because they give me the chance to meet new people and widen my set of skills and expertise to exceed what they teach us at school. 
My school along with a number of schools belongs to a large association. So, it presents us many chances to participate in activities outside the school. For instance, I have participated in multiple Makassed science fairs where my friends and I cooperated to prepare projects that won us the 1st or 2nd place. I also participated in a Makassed Computer fair in which I won the 3rd place. Moreover, I participated in two Makassed theatre competitions where I played the lead role in one of the plays. I also participated in a Makassed Speech Giving competition and I won the 2nd place. My school gave me many opportunities to represent it outside the school and I never turned it down. 
I also participated in many activites outside the Makassed association. For example, my friends and I won the 3rd place in a Mathematics and Science Fair at AUB. 
One of the most memorable experiences in my life is when I was chosen among the students of my school to participate in the Summer Research Experience in Physics (SREP) at AUB last summer. I made many friends and I met respected doctors who have made significant contributions in their fields. I got to increase my knowledge in physics while enjoying the beautiful campus of AUB.
Another extracurricular activity that I'm proud to have participated in is the Leadership Workshop at Haigazian University. In this experience I also made many friends, and I widened my set of skills in life. We learned the components of efficient leadership which are necessary to succeed in any field in life.
Another activity that I must mention is volunteering. I have completed 45 official hours of volunteering -that I wish I got the chance to increase- beside the random volunteering that I did with my friends. During my volunteering with the Makassed Volunteering group, I helped in cleaning streets, organizing multiple events (for children, graduation events, and others). Being able to help my community through volunteering was really a very valuable experience for me because it assured me of the value of putting a smile on others' faces. My friends and I also did a lot of volunteering inside our communities like cleaning our street, taking the kids of the neighborhood to football fields for them to enjoy playing football, and tutoring some of the kids in the neighborhood who had trouble at school.
I also enrolled in a Biomedical Engineering workshop at RHU that increased my love for this major and taught me a new set of skills in engineering and teamwork.

In 2017, I participated in the Environmental Championship Program which took place in villages along the Lebanon Mountain Trail and opened my eyes to our relationship with the environment. In Grade 7, I participated in The National Competition in iSmart and won a Champion Trophy. I improved my English language skills online on my own in Grade 9 using the ZAmericanEnglish application. In addition, I studied Grade 11 at Hastings High School in the United States through the scholarship Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study (YES) Program which was a great step in my personal growth journey as it enhanced my sense of responsibility and openness to new experiences. As a YES student, I learned about the American culture and society and shared about the Lebanese one; I also volunteered at Hastings Family Service, a local organisation helping those in need, and joined the Tennis and Ultimate Frisbee teams at Hastings High School. 
Being back in Lebanon after my exchange year in the U.S., I'm grateful for the friends I reunited with at home and the new ones I've made. For example, my classmates and I planned and organised a movie night for the youth which was fun for everyone; we watched two movies: Moana and Divergent. I was glad to engage with people who came to watch from different age groups. 
Additionally, Sadhguru has been one of my mentors in life - I've been watching his videos and doing Yoga regularly, and I volunteer online in the Arabic Translation Team for the Conscious Planet - Save Soil movement that he started aiming to bring about a conscious response to soil extinction. In the summer of 2022, I took Inner Engineering Online, a comprehensive course for personal growth designed by Sadhguru, then I started volunteering in the translation team for Sadhguru Arabic YouTube Channel, which fills my heart with gratitude and joy, as I'm not only watching life changing content, but also contributing to spreading it by translating it from English to Arabic.

   I never knew how to answer when “what is your favorite color?”  was directed my way. Out of thousands of shades, monochromes, and lights, all I could do was sit back and marvel at such wide arrays of beauty. This philosophy manifested in various aspects throughout my life where I prioritized being well-rounded above all else. This is why I seized every opportunity I could get my fingers on to propel myself out of my comfort zone and refine myself under pressure and responsibility.
   The great fascination I had with pursuing knowledge presented itself when,  fresh out of my middle school years, I was already a two-time champion nationally in the UAE's Arabic reading challenge and a little scientist with multiple experiences and awards in Makassed, AUB, and BAU science and technology fairs.
   During the entrepreneurial Global Enterprise Challenge, I learned to be the change I wanted in the world through a product me and my team designed, manufactured, marketed, and sold. It was an interactive board game designed to bridge the inaccessibility gap in the toys industry for visually impaired kids. Our “Vocabulous” was chosen for the 3rd place among 218 schools over the world. 
   This, along with my experience as a team-lead in NASA’s Great Lunar Expedition for Everyone program where I conducted bi-monthly meetings, researched and familiarized members with module topics, and worked with my team to assemble the LunaSats, shaped who I would become as a leader and an activist.
  Just this summer, I got the opportunity to represent Lebanon in the Microsoft Office World Championship in California due to previously certifying in Microsoft Word and winning at the MOS school and national championship. 
  In the recent I-Earn campaign me and my teammates launched, we were able to dive further into the world's geopolitical aspects as we wrote a report detailing plans for the Sustainable Development Goals and their regional implementation. The campaign made some noise, and we were invited to participate in the first sub-regional student forum to discuss our ideas with like-minded students in Jordan. 
  Throughout my highschool years, I was furthermore able to take part of our Makassed Volunteering Unit; I managed refreshment stands in the 2021 Beirut Marathon, packaged food for distribution, and handed out meals in Ramadan. My community service was especially enriched when I became a peer tutor for the Makassed Writing center where I spent half to two hours per week holding analysis, consultation, and advisory sessions for tutees according to their learning styles. I additionally was a member of the StrongerByChoice breast cancer initiative where I created awareness content and organized a final exhibition for the initiative.
 This appreciation for multidimensionalism won’t finalize until I reach white, a color which reflects the wavelengths of every shade in existence. However, as I reflect approaching the age of adulthood, I realize that the pursuit of completeness in experiences isn’t a search, but rather a journey, with every step along the way being as equally significant as the destination.

I have been fortunate enough to participate in several such initiatives, each of which has allowed me to grow and develop as a person. 

   The first project that I took part in was the preparation for the ""Bullying Day"" event. The objective of this project was to create awareness about the issue of bullying and to provide support to those who have been victims of it. I had the opportunity to use my creativity and hard work to design and decorate a whole room, the teacher's office, to create a safe and welcoming environment for students who may need help. My peers and I put in a lot of effort to create a visually appealing and comforting space that would be a sanctuary for those who needed it. I was assigned to decorate a wall in the room when I suggested a fantastic idea to decorate it. After everyone agreement, I started working on implementing my idea and pushed myself to draw a large drawing, which was difficult and exhausting for me since I had never drawn a drawing of this size before. However, it turned out to be fantastic and both the teacher and my peers liked it. They helped me to finish decorating the rest of the wall, and that's how we completed decorating the room. Seeing the room come together in the end was a truly rewarding experience, and it was heartening to know that our efforts could help someone in need. 

   One of the most memorable volunteering campaigns I have been a part of is called ""Winter Clothes Campaign."" This campaign aimed to provide warm clothing to the underprivileged individuals who could not afford proper winter clothing during the cold season. I had the privilege of sorting and organizing the clothes that were donated and making sure that they were in good condition. It was a fulfilling experience to know that my efforts would bring warmth and comfort to those in need. 

   Apart from volunteering events and campaigns, I have also participated in several workshops that have helped me develop my skills and knowledge. One of the most beneficial workshops I took part in was the Microsoft Office course, where I learned how to use several software programs like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Furthermore, I participated in a PHP course, which provides a comprehensive introduction to server-side web development using PHP. We learned the basics of PHP programming, such as the data types, operators, control structures, functions, and arrays. Additionally, we learned about web development with PHP, in which we learned how to develop web applications using PHP and integrate it with HTML and CSS. 

In conclusion, my involvement in volunteering and various community projects has been a truly rewarding and enriching experience. It has developed my skills and knowledge.",0,"American University of Beirut (AUB), Lebanese American University (LAU)",No,Divorced,No,No,No,No,No,0,No,Done,Done,745,Eligible,Considered,Expenses Higher,0,TRUE,1,Avg,individual strongly believe power volunteering actively engaging various project event campaign workshop aim make positive impact community fortunate enough participate several initiative allowed grow develop person first project took part preparation bullying day event objective project create awareness issue bullying provide support victim opportunity use creativity hard work design decorate whole room teacher office create safe welcoming environment student may need help peer put lot effort create visually appealing comforting space would sanctuary needed assigned decorate wall room suggested fantastic idea decorate everyone agreement started working implementing idea pushed draw large drawing difficult exhausting since never drawn drawing size however turned fantastic teacher peer liked helped finish decorating rest wall thats completed decorating room seeing room come together end truly rewarding experience heartening know effort could help someone need one memorable volunteering campaign part called winter clothes campaign campaign aimed provide warm clothing underprivileged individual could afford proper winter clothing cold season privilege sorting organizing clothes donated making sure good condition fulfilling experience know effort would bring warmth comfort need apart volunteering event campaign also participated several workshop helped develop skill knowledge one beneficial workshop took part microsoft office course learned use several software program like word excel powerpoint furthermore participated php course provides comprehensive introduction serverside web development using php learned basic php programming data type operator control structure function array additionally learned web development php learned develop web application using php integrate html cs conclusion involvement volunteering various community project truly rewarding enriching experience developed skill knowledge,0.194359277,Nothing,4,4,0,7,7,0,0,4,0
Yes,Female,2023-2024,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,UNRWA,No,Life Sciences - LS,92.24,0.84375,0.875,Yes,1 time,"Participating in social activities is one of the things that I really admire, for it gives one the chance to meet people of different cultures, socialize, share, have fun, in addition to strengthening his sense of belonging. Unfortunately, the spread of coronavirus in 2019 led to a sharp decrease in the social activities throughout the world, or rather, it reduces people's ability in participating in such activities, especially in its first two years. Yet, I had the chance to be a part of some activities.

Due to the lockdown of the whole city, many workshops were done online using zoom or microsoft teams or whatever. In August 2022, I participated in online workshops that were done by some LAU students, where each workshop talked about one important topic. Those were very helpful, for they provide me with interesting information as they give me motivation and inspiration. The aim of those workshops was to shed light on topics that are important for us to know about as teenagers; they presented about power of emotional intelligence, power of creativity, and power of organizational skills. They highlighted the importance of these topics in our life, as they asked  but also encouraged us to discuss whatever we think of . This made each session much more interesting and beneficial since we had the chance to talk, discuss, and express our own opinions !

Moreover, in November 2022, I had the chance to participate in ""app development workshop"" which taught us how to create our own apps using MIT app inventor. This had many positive impacts on me. First, since I went there knowing no one from the students neither the leaders, I had to socialize with people I don't know in order to make new friends. Second, this workshop worked more on strengthening the importance of cooperation in us as well as working as a cooperative group. Also, keeping on attempting till reaching a good result was an important key in that work. App development was something I learn about for the first time, yet, by the end of the workshop, I was able to create my own project by myself.

In January 2023, I participated in first aid workshop ; it was my favorite one due to my keen interests in every part of the medical work. It taught us about the symptoms of some sudden disorders like heart attacks and strokes, in addition to giving tips on how to deal with these. It also provided us with much information about first aid actions by telling what to do as well as what we must not do. The best part of this workshop was the practice part where the leader, who is a surgeon assistant, asked some of us to practice some of the most important first aid actions.

Another activity that I really enjoyed is the Iftar project for poor fasting people done last year in Ramadan in Beddawi Camp. This project was the best, for it allows us as volunteers to actually see how people are benefiting from our work. My desire to help people pushed me to participate in this project. It was really an amazing work, for good intention and cooperation were the most important two keys in order to get this work perfectly done .

Furthermore, Al Mashari scouts do lots of activities which I continuously participate in. Not only do these volunteering activities entertain me, but they also benefit me. The more activities I participate in, the more I socialize, and the more different cultures I know. Some of these activities, which I really enjoyed, was organizing a party for 2022 graduates and organizing important sessions about cholera, the bacteria that was expected to occupy the world just as Covid-19. Without team work and cooperation, such activities do not succeed; that's why I believe that volunteering activities are very important since they develop our skills.

In conclusion, social activities in general, whether they are volunteering ones, workshops, or campaigns are something that really benefits us.

Yes,Male,2023-2024,No,No,Yes,No,Private,Yes,Life Sciences - LS,96,80,88.3,Yes,1 time,"As an individual, I owe my community a duty to promote good life conditions for everyone. No one 
deserves to live in the shadows. I strive to protect human rights and democracy through raising 
awareness, exposing violations and calling for accountability. Social media provides a platform to easily 
reach everyone; thus, following credible news media and human rights organizations, I update my 
Instagram followers with national events and call out violations. For example, during the civil uprisings in 
Lebanon in 2019, protestors were illegally attacked and shot with live ammunition, and many lost an 
eye, an ear, and some, a palm, for the sake of social, economic and political reform. Moreover, I am 
deeply concerned about the exclusion of women and minority groups from the decision-making process. 
Being in a relatively aggressive society towards these groups, I cannot but advocate for their integration. 
If inspiring the later generations to change fails, orienting the youth towards adopting human values 
seems to pay off. 

Change needs time, but it can be accelerated with a catalyst: free spaces. In order to relate to others’ 
experiences and incorporate individuals from various backgrounds in making decisions, I decided to 
found a social-debate club where everyone willing to improve the Lebanese society is welcome to 
participate and share their thoughts and ideas, without fear or reluctance. Through the Instagram page, 
Lebanese Youth for Change, we are trying to attract like-minded people and influence others who are 
resistant to change into a modern, free society. The goal is to organize at least one debate monthly to 
discuss various international topics such as gun control, social norms and the future of humanity. The 
club achieves its objectives by following the motto: “To change something, build a new model that 
makes the existing model obsolete.”

 Academically, I have initiated till now two reasearch papers: one that is concerned about the situation 
of the LGBT community in Lebanon and another that tackles the deteriorating role of media to become 
into a propaganda tool. Despite how taxing and demanding these papers have been, I appreciated every 
little aspect of the process, from researching to analyzing statistical results emerging from conducted 
surveys. By that, I hope to chisel my analytical skills for a soft transition to university life.
 This scholarship would allow me to employ my skills into action, especially that I portray significant 
consistency and passion to forge social change. It would also expose me to essential opportunities and 
expertise through workshops and social work. In addition, I am eager to expand my social circle and 
become more social to better lead my future with networking and good communication, as this 
programs also prepare tomorrow’s leaders by shaping their personalities and skills.

This passion to help elders emerged from a tragic incident that occurred when I was in grade eight. Back then, my grandmother was suffering from cancer, and after a whole year of agony, she passed away. Since then, I've promised myself not to miss a chance to help people who are suffering and to give them a shoulder to cry on. Consequently, when the coronavirus pandemic struck our country, I volunteered with the ""Public Health Committee Dispensary"" to be a productive member. I used to help the committee through their visits to the infected people by making PCRS for them, disinfecting their houses, and moving suffering patients to the hospitals. In addition, I am still volunteering with them up till now. Moreover, I volunteered at ""Al Iklim Public Health Chhim Center"" last summer where I used to help nurses in assisting old people who were physically ill. I've taken several roles in teamwork activities as well; I've been participating since the end of last year in ""The Life Sculptor Organization"" where I'm an active member and a second_tier volunteer in the Research Team that is responsible to come up with reliable and accurate information and data to be presented in webinars and interactive sessions. What motivates me the most is the feeling of satisfaction and joy that I experience whenever I help anyone in anything no matter how tiny it is.

This led me to volunteer in a variety of settings, including Camp Leaders as a counselor for children, working at J's Preschool as a teacher, and joining the Yearbook Committee as a newsletter writer and photographer.
At Camp Leaders, I had the opportunity to work closely with children and provide them with a fun and engaging summer camp experience. As a counselor, I was responsible for leading activities, supervising children, and providing emotional support when needed. This experience taught me valuable skills in communication, leadership, and problem-solving, all while making a positive impact on the lives of young children.
My work at J's Preschool as a teacher allowed me to have a more direct impact on children's education and development. I was responsible for leading lessons, organizing activities, and creating a safe and welcoming environment for children to learn and grow. This experience taught me the importance of patience, creativity, and adaptability in working with children of different ages and learning styles.
Finally, joining the Yearbook Committee as a newsletter writer and photographer allowed me to combine my love of photography and writing with my desire to be involved in school activities. I was responsible for capturing important moments and events throughout the school year and sharing them with the rest of the student body through the school newsletter. This experience taught me valuable skills in photography, writing, and teamwork, while also allowing me to contribute to the school community in a meaningful way.
Overall, my experiences volunteering in Kuwait have taught me valuable skills in communication, leadership, education, and creative expression. These experiences have not only helped me grow as a person but have also allowed me to make a positive impact on the lives of children and the community as a whole. I am grateful for these opportunities and look forward to continuing to give back in any way I can. I am eager to volunteer and give back to my country in any way possible.

That is when I decided to volunteer in an organization called Al Ka’en Social Organization for many reasons.
 During attendance, we would work on arranging fundraising campaigns that consisted of collecting money, clothing, and basic necessities which then would be rightfully distributed by us to whoever needs them. In order to distribute the goods equally among our people, I and other participants would organize aid lists and personally deliver the donations according to another schedule previously prepared. Moreover, I took charge of planning and mentoring trips to various types of shelters with our administrator, to distribute aid and collect information about the shelters’ needs as well. Among those activities, we would also host open days to entertain children whilst giving them sensory inducing experiences and activities to help those in need of mental assistance. 
During the entire phase of volunteering, it made me realize the importance of spreading awareness on the silent struggles of the people and the country we live in, it also made me realize that though struggles differ from one household to another, and one individual to another, all of us tug back at the roots of unity wherever we go. 
Leadership is one of the things I attained during my volunteering days, where I not only learnt how to be fully independent, but also learnt how to step forward and carry the weights of other people with me, as individuals, as friends, and as family; whether blood related or not.

There were so many hikes organized and many more days of cleaning nature and sharing our talents. There were many classes and sessions to teach people of different ages many things and help them gain a wonderful experience and many talents like playing music, singing, drawing, etc. This changed me a lot as a person and it taught me the right way to hold responsibilities and to be someone people can count on. Moreover, this year I attended several workshops at my school that were held by teenagers and young adults who were part of the Lebanese red cross. Attending these workshops taught me a lot. First, I learned that we, this generation, can become everything we want to become. These workshops gave me hope and taught me that nothing is impossible. Second, I learned that protecting our nature is the most important thing to do because we're heading towards many disasters if we don't take care of our environment. Outside of school, I'm a person who always seeks to take leadership positions, and I tend to be a great and confident person whose goal is to make the earth a better place and whose best weapon is public speaking.

We were ten groups; each consist of ten members. In my group, I was associated the leader who organizes the role of the other nine members. My group was responsible for Baalbek and its surroundings. We were supposed to collect at least 2000 cup since we aimed on getting the as many items as we can. To make the point clearer, the NGO promised us that for each 2000 cups, we can get one trolley that’s why we were working hard to collect more than 2000. Fortunately, we reached our goal in collecting the cups, but despite that we felt sad to notice such amount of garbage in our cities roads. 
I volunteering in another social program with the Lebanese organization for studies and training. This program aimed at distributing tables, chairs, markers, boards, chalks, and kids’ chairs for public schools. I was a member in this distributing team for 2 weeks where I shared in helping three public schools in Baalbek region.
Add to that, I also shared in a workshop with NGO. This workshop was suggested after the ethnic hatred that happened in Lebanon due to the corrupted politicians. It aims at visiting different regions of Lebanon under the title “We are all Lebanese”. We aimed at identifying ourselves under our nationality and not our regions and denominations. Each group was from different city from Lebanon and was supposed to let other groups know more about the city’s beliefs, accents and what specializes it.

       Three months later, I volunteered in a medical association in our camp . Actually,  my tasks were not that hard , but the 2 months I spent in this association taught me a lot. I learned to be patient, specially when facing complicated situations since being stressed will never solve the problem, it will complicate it more. Also, I recognized more the importance of teamwork. Working in the medical field or in any another field in this life needs teamwork spirit and that what I improved during this volunteering. 
      I also discovered an organisation while scrolling on my social media. It is a student-led organisation that supplies students with virtual workshops and that what had came to my attention.  I participated in many of their workshops.  It started with a workshop about cybersecurity, then a Phobia workshop talking about the different types of Phibia, followed by another one about abortion from both medical and legal points of view, and a time management workshop that helped me a lot learning how to manage my time correctly. Not only that,  but I participated also in a debate about civil rights and another workshops about learning disabilities,  trauma, employability skills and some other topics.

One of my most valuable experiences in the world of volunteering was when I volunteered with Blue Mission in the program ""Covid-19 and the vaccine: How to Debunk Rumors"". During this program, I learned a great deal about the pandemic and how to educate others about it. I also had the opportunity to volunteer at al-Kharoubi Hospital, where I helped register elderly people for the vaccine.

These experiences have allowed me to connect with my community and make a real difference in the lives of others.

The society, ideas, and values that surround me will inevitably determine who I am, so when I better my community, I am bettering myself.
I found that I can best contribute to that through free education.
It is very easy for growing children to internalize the ideas of their parents and grandparents, even if they are wrong and outdated; and although I do not consider it my duty or right to form people’s opinions for them, I do think it is my duty to provide them with the tools they need to form their own thoughts.
Having adept English skills is one of these tools. When people can read and understand texts -whether they are from a novel or a finance magazine or a political newspaper- then skillfully express their opinions about them, they become active members in society.
The form of education I give my students does not resemble the traditional one in any way: it is directly applicable to real life. Focusing more on conversational skills, evidence-based analysis, and expression of ideas, I teach my students to confidently interact with English culture.
This experience has taught and continues to teach me many things. I have learned to adapt to teaching students with different skill levels and backgrounds. Learning to communicate with different parts of my community made me feel like I truly belonged, no matter how heterogeneous the world around me is.
Towards the end of the pandemic, my school was at risk of shutting down due to fear of the widespread of the virus. To stop this from happening, I –along with my school’s health club- organized a campaign to convince students to get vaccinated and protect themselves.
We conducted various research about the vaccine, its potency, and potential side effects. We then printed brochures that belied misinformation spread about the vaccines and highlighted the importance of vaccination on a personal and societal level. 
I also had private discussions with people who were unwilling to change their minds and dispelled any fears they had. 
While we did not manage to convince all students to get vaccinated, a good percentage did and the number of cases went down significantly.

They are defined by their personality, behavior, and interests. In other words, they are defined by what they do outside of schoolwork. There are several activities that I enjoyed and am proud of doing outside of schoolwork.

In 10th grade, I participated in one of Shabab Lab’s programs in which my partner and I had to make a website that solves an environmental issue. In this program, we were taught briefly about entrepreneurship and how to build a website using WordPress. We created a website called “Ecoplastic” and despite not winning, we managed to get an honorable mention.

In addition, I participated in an AUB and BAU science fair along with 3 of my colleagues and presented a power point about how exercise enhances cognitive activity. We won first place in the AUB science fair but only received a participation certificate in that in BAU.

As for the club activities, I was in the school choir for a couple of years and I once sang with the choir for the seniors’ graduation ceremony.
Other than that, I’ve been a member in the basketball club’s team at BAU since I was thirteen, but then I joined the basketball club at Champs at sixteen. However, I left basketball altogether recently as I slowly lost interest in the sport.

During 10th and 11th grade, I participated in a community service program called “Alwan” or “Adyan”. Throughout the program, my classmates and I met students from other schools and got to know more about other religions. We also served our community by reducing deforestation through planting cedar trees. 

There are also some activities that I’ll do in the near future. Some of my friends and I are planning to paint a mural in the school playground with the help of our art teacher. This mural is to raise awareness about environmental issues and encourage students at our school to keep their environment safe and clean. Furthermore, I have registered for the engineering and computer science courses held by the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science at AUST which will begin by the end of January.

To sum up, I’ve had a lot of fun doing these activities in the past years and I’m proud of all my accomplishments. And many more achievements are yet to be realized in the future.

  Moreover, volunteering allows you to connect to your community and make it a better place.It can bring meaning and purpose to your life, while increasing your self-esteem and wellbeing.

  It has been an essential step that changed my life by gaining experiences in social work in addition to interacting with people from other societies and being able to understand the different patterns of thinking, regardless all those differences we had, especially the lucky chance I had to be a part of the LEAP project that was conducted by Beit Atfal Assumoud and volunteers from USA in order to improve the English fluency of the young adults here, were I had the chance to interact with American people and to be introduced to their mentality and ways of thinking, and practice creative writing by one of the most successful people in this domain. Through such experiences, we were able to acknowledge those volunteers about our life here in Lebanon as refugees and introduce them to our traditions and the conditions we were tackling inside the camp.

   Also, I had the honor to volunteer in Sights Without Rights, one of projects of Alaila….. , an Italian association, which handled the responsibility to acknowledge people in Italy about the Palestinian people in Lebanon and the dilemmas those people are facing here as refugees, by which I was responsible for making interviews with local people in Borj al Shamali Camp, taking the strategies of creative writing and how to translate the issues were facing as Palestinian by words. This project was ended by an exhibition both in Lebanon and Italy.

Furthermore, and through volunteering in ""Diyarona"", a local NGO, I've worked with children and participated in several workshops tackling copious topics. To elucidate, several workshops have been performed inorder to introduce the young generation to new topics including human rights, gender discrimination and how to face it . Also, i was a member in a team that  prepared for a day to celebrate the Palestinian traditions in Borj Al shamali camp.
    In addition to that, and due to the importance of psychological knowledge and wellbeing, I was a part of workshops that were responsible for spreading awareness on topics such as bipolar disorder, traumas and how to deal with such complications, self esteem and the ways to boost it… and on the behalf of preparing for the future, i participated in a workshop about freelancing in Sebline conducted by UNRWA and WPA. Add to that, and in a program conducted by UNIFIL, I had the honor to take Italian courses, in addition to other courses regarding self-defense. 
    To sum up, all these workshops and volunteering opportunities add a lot to my knowledge and enhance my experience in life.

Activities play an important role in our lives, providing us with opportunities to explore our interests, develop skills, and create meaningful connections with others. Engaging in activities, especially for students, is essential to maintain a healthy and fulfilling life.

One of my primary extra-curricular activities is volunteering. I have been a participant at ""Masjid Al Hussein"" mosque in Saida for 8 years, and I hold several leadership positions. I first entered when I was in grade 5, where we used to study and memorize ""Quran"" and do several activities and trips. As I grew up, I moved from being a student to a teacher. I became one of the official organizers responsible for the workflow at the mosque. For example, I'm responsible for several members in the organization, where I help in organizing activities and trips, and give them lessons about several topics in ""???? ??????? ?? ???? ??????"". Additionally, I am a member of the informatics committee at the mosque, where I work as a photographer and social media manager. I take photos and videos of the lessons and activities we do, and post them at social media pages.

In addition, I participated in organizing the journey that was held in Saida sponsored by “????? ????"" under the name of ""??????? ????????? ???????? ?? ????? ????"". I also always participate in activities at school. For example, I participated in 2021 in an activity by the U.K for debunking rumors about the Covid-19 vaccine, where we did researches and a poll about people's thoughts about the vaccine. I was also a part of the bake sale I did with my friends at school to support patients of breast cancer financially, in which we donated the income we got for these patients.

Moreover, I participated several times in different competitions. In grade 6, I participated in LAU-MAL in Beirut and won the ""best delegate award"". This achievement ignited the fuse to participate in the competition in upcoming years. So I participated in grade 8 in LAU-MUN, in grade 10 in HHHS-MUN (which was held online due to the lockdown), and in grade 11 at HHHS-MUN.

Lastly, I entered in grades 5 and 6 in the ""Smart"" club at my school in which I learned to perform mathematical operations using the ""abacus"". After I mastered this skill, I participated in several competitions. In grade 6, I won at the competition held in Saida, so I advanced to the local competition in Lebanon that was held at ""??? ?????????"" in Beirut. 

In conclusion, my extra-curricular activities have had a significant impact on my personal growth. They have taught me the value of empathy, kindness, and selflessness. I have developed valuable skills such as teamwork and collaboration, made meaningful connections, and gained a greater understanding of myself and the world around me.

I could cross the whole pool for the first time with no fear and no assistance. Two months ago, though, I thought it was impossible. Though still not a professional, I am delighted for overcoming what I called my biggest fear and unveiling a new interest.

Moreover, my interest lies in helping others. For this, I was a scout at Al Iman Scouts and became a volunteer in grade 10 at three different organizations that shared common activities. We prepared iftar during Ramadan, donated clothes and toys, joined Fanoussy, took part in Beirut Marathon, helped the unaided, stood by the Lebanese after the Beirut Port explosion that shook the whole country… It is sometimes hard to juggle between school and volunteering; however, seeing the children jumping of joy and hearing the elderly's duaa heals my soul in a way a professional psychologist never can. It felt like an escape from this harsh world into one where differences do not exist and tolerance is the bedrock.

In addition to that, I believe I used my time this summer in a purposeful way. For instance, I took some free online courses offered by WHO, UNICEF, Harvard, and Google which showed a glance at each faculty and eventually helped me choose the right majors. I am also a student at icademy and life sculpture which offer interesting sessions hosted by university students. Furthermore, I attended various workshops that aimed at helping students choose the right university and major.
 
 In the summer of 2019, I taught preschoolers at my school's summer camp, which helped me understand more job responsibilities and develop strong leadership skills.

Not to forget about all the competitions I participated in, especially the international letter-writing competition. The year 2020 still gave a glimpse of hope as I ranked first in Arab countries in the aforementioned competition and got an unexpected special phone call from the former Minister of Education, Tarek El Majzoub, inviting me to his office to congratulate me on this accomplishment. A few months later, I was Omar Al Hout's guest on Fajr Radio and was recognized by Liban Post who sent me glorious, thoughtful gifts.

Briefly, such extracurricular activities have had a great impact in defining my personality and shaping my future. They helped me learn about my interests, build intimate friendships, and gain transferable skills.

This project involves teaching children how to play chess and helping younger students with their academic studies. Through this project, I have been able to make a positive impact on the lives of those around me while also developing important skills and qualities that will serve me well in the future.
Let me start by talking about my work teaching children how to play chess. As someone who is passionate about the game, I have always believed that chess has the power to teach valuable life skills to young people. Whether it's strategic thinking, decision-making, or problem-solving, chess requires a level of concentration and focus that is hard to find in other activities. That's why I decided to start a program where I teach children how to play chess in a fun and engaging way. Over the years, I have worked with children of all ages and backgrounds, and I have seen firsthand the positive impact that chess can have on their lives. Not only do they learn how to play a new game, but they also develop critical thinking skills and build self-confidence that will serve them well in other areas of their lives.
In addition to teaching chess, I also help younger students with their academic studies. Whether it's helping them with homework, tutoring them in a particular subject, or simply being there to listen and offer advice, I have found that this work is incredibly rewarding. By helping students succeed in school, I know that I am making a real difference in their lives. I have also developed important skills in communication, patience, and empathy, which will serve me well in any future endeavors.
Overall, I am incredibly proud of the work that I have done through this volunteer project. By teaching children how to play chess and helping younger students with their academic studies, I have been able to make a positive impact on the lives of those around me. More importantly, I have developed important skills and qualities that will serve me well in the future.

One of the perks that I get to enjoy is taking part in setting up workshops and activities in my local community and outside communities. For example, some days we would organize workshops at the Al-Jaleel camp in Baalabak and sometimes they would be directed toward young kids by setting some exercises and toys, and sometimes it would be cultural activities where we would present something related to our Palestinian culture and heritage and it would be directed towards all ages. 

In addition to that, we have gone camping several times to places like Ameek, Dar Hanan, and Omar Mokhtar where I would be in charge of making sure everything is properly set and maintained. We would also organize some social events on these camping trips to promote collaboration and engagement among the attendees. Moreover, I am also involved in my school when it comes to setting up workshops to raise awareness on certain topics, like personal hygiene, keeping our community clean, helping one another, and so on. 

I am a very active and outgoing person, I like to be involved in social exercises and meet new people.

Another unforgettable experience was when I visited a refugee camp with Al-Rouwad school. We interacted with the refugees and provided them with food and fun activities to engage in.

The program was held online at the time due to the Covid-19 pandemic, so it was a much more diverse experience than the last LAU competition I participated in in 2017 (MAL) and held a much more mature audience. This experience was an incredible opportunity to gain public speaking skills, social confidence, leadership skills, and much more. The intensive research that was also required of the delegates was an abundant task on its own that helped me gain an invaluable skill that assists me to this day. But most importantly the heavyweight that was carried during this competition allowed me to bear responsibilities on my own and grow as a person. I also participated in a National Dance Competition with my school’s dance team in 2019, where we witnessed the portrayal of various categories of dance from different cultures. This experience not only was an adventure on its own but also a cure to the stage fright that I suffered from back then and allowed me to defy my fear in later years. It was an overall fun experience and a great opportunity to represent my school in front of other schools in Lebanon. Recently this year, I have participated in several workshops covering diverse subjects such as Computer Science and Life Skills. One of these workshops was a Communication Skills workshop that identified the different types of personalities that people possess and how to understand people’s behaviors and what they could indicate about the person expressing them. The workshop also gave tips and ideas on how to handle aggressive situations and resolve a conflict between individuals and others or between others and yourself. Another workshop I participated in was an Introduction to Computer science where that major was introduced by a graduate of a university in Lebanon. The host gave us an idea about the major hold of programs and platforms and how we can wield these programs to develop software and various projects, as well as the general information that is presented by this major. The workshop proved to be valuable to those who wanted to inquire about studying the major such as myself and helped reinforce the decision to pursue the major. The last workshop I recently participated in was on “Surfing the Web” where the host identified the difference between the deep web and the dark web and their functions of them. He further explained the precautions that needed to be taken to ensure the safety of one’s devices and privacy, as well as certain measures that can be taken to avoid being hacked or compromised.

I am applying for the ULYP scholarship because I know the power of education is one of the only forces strong enough to give me the tools I need to transcend the difficult environment I grow up in
My first goal is to study chemistry at AUB or LAU since they are the best college in Lebanon and are known worldwide.
In school, my chemistry grades were not that good at all I failed several times in the test but even though I tried to pass and finally have succeed with a good mark, my teacher was so proud of me that I had what I wanted in the end and it was a huge success that I achieved my goal
For me, chemistry is the life I would think like protons and stay positive.

The former is vital to ensure credibility while giving a speech for example, and the content of the speech is as important because a well-informed personality is key. In addition, I have also participated in a Robotics Workshop where we learned how to program, build, and control a robot. All have aided me in enhancing my critical thinking skills in addition to improving my cognitive performance. Especially knowing that I will be going into Computer Engineering, that workshop was vital in not only giving me background information about programming, but it also gave me a great feeling that this major is definitely for me. My passion has grown ever since. Hopefully, I will use these skills that I have been granted to give back to my community by providing the underprivileged and the needy newly graduates job opportunities in my company later on.

I would play with them and say fun activities and go out on trips with them, teach them things and feed them sometimes, and that made me very happy.
This is what developed in me the spirit of leadership, volunteerism and organization
Its activities also help to make a person properly organize his time, which is very useful
I also joined the scouts, which was a dream for me. I became the leader of a small group, and together we do wonderful scouting trips. This was one of the best experiences that I had.

My participation in an array of volunteer initiatives, events, and organizations has equipped me with vital skills and enabled me to positively impact the lives of others.

One of my most notable experiences has been my involvement in Model United Nations (MUN) and Model Arab League (MAL) at the Lebanese American University (LAU). These programs offered me the chance to engage in discourses on global issues, hone my public speaking and negotiation abilities, and collaborate with students from diverse backgrounds. Exposure to varying perspectives and the capacity to critically analyze intricate problems have deepened my comprehension of global affairs and cultivated a sense of responsibility towards fostering a better world.

Another significant aspect of my journey has been volunteering at the Lebanese Red Cross Youth Sector. Through this experience, I have gleaned the importance of empathy, teamwork, and adaptability. I have participated in numerous activities, such as organizing blood drives, providing first aid during events, and raising awareness about health and safety concerns. These experiences have not only enabled me to serve my community but also molded my character and fortified my commitment to humanitarian endeavors. Moreover, I have had the opportunity to interact and forge connections with numerous individuals, enhancing my communication skills and learning from their insights and guidance as top-achieving students in various university majors.

In addition to these extracurricular pursuits, I have engaged in academic events such as ""The Economist Global Conversation"" and the National Science Fair. My participation in the Global Conversation has expanded my worldview and prompted me to think critically about pressing global challenges. My involvement in the National Science Fair resulted in a bronze medal for my science project, demonstrating my dedication, ingenuity, and problem-solving capabilities.

Furthermore, I am consistently eager to embrace new experiences and intend to partake in numerous events and activities in the future. I believe that these multifaceted experiences distinguish me beyond my academic achievements, as they have facilitated the development of a well-rounded personality, a robust sense of civic duty, and the ability to adapt to novel situations and challenges.

I believe that students shouldn't wait until they graduate from school to do volunteer instead, they should take the initiative to do volunteering work for their community and community members . Luckily, I found Azahir a community based organization, where I'm volunteering on Fridays and Sundays to help the teachers there, in teaching the students. In addition, on summer vacation, I used to help the facilitators while  giving fun recreational activities to the children. At the end of the day, I am trying my best to contribute in my community,  to leave even a slight impact and to be a good example for those of my age and for the children I work with at Azahir. And that's what makes me special outside my school work.
Other than that, I volunteered at the Lebanese Red Crescent and Al-Shifa Medical Center in the summer, where I learned a lot from: normal human levels (blood pressure / oxygen rate / blood sugar...), the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the importance of organs, and so on. It seemed that this year I entered a workshop via the Internet. Some of them talk about violence and bullying, and some of them go to the world of medicine, and some of them go to the human psychological world. All this was not enough, and in the end I went with my teacher at school to apply some activities for the little children in our kindergarten in Nahr Al-Bared camp. When we arrived, I integrated myself among them and we started the fun activities.

To start with, I participated in LAU's Model United Nations program. I completed the position paper and attended the training and mock sessions, even though I regrettably was unable to attend the final two days on Byblos campus and hence wasn't part of the final conference. Although I had numerous challenges while preparing for the simulated session, including stress and lack of information at the start, I performed admirably at the conference, where my strong speech satisfied the delegates and the audience. This experience improved my self-esteem in addition to my time management, public speaking, communication, research, and interpersonal skills. In addition, I did some workshops and programs that let me explore my multiple interests, such as the cybersecurity workshop, an electrical engineering about renewable energy workshop, decision making, life skills, computer science, and digital marketing....I learned the fundamentals of cybersecurity, like risk migration and transmission, cyberattacks, and remedies, in the cybersecurity training offered by iCademy. I have also done decision-making and life skills workshops with LifeSculpture, and they shed light on the steps of decision-making like identification of the purpose, information gathering, and principles for judging and analyzing the alternatives. Regarding the RHU electrical engineering workshop, I learned about solar panels and how to maximize their utility. It dealt with how solar panels should rotate in relation to the sun and how they are made. I recall interacting with the doctor and responding to many of his questions, as well as taking a brief quiz after that. Furthermore, I have worked the last 2 summers in the building and electrical domain in addition to solar panel installation, where I worked to cover my personal expenses and gain knowledge that would help in university and later in life. This experience gave me a lot of confidence in dealing with people, making new friends, and experiencing how the real world operates. I also realized that I am a good communicator when my subordinate at work frequently chose me to help him because of my good analytical skills. To add, I volunteered to tutor a fifth-grader in a few of the areas that helped him earn outstanding grades, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I have also been a part of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, which really impressed me by touching people's hearts, unlocking new skills, making new friends, and helping my fellow Palestinians. Along with the school, I took part in mathematical and historical competitions. In addition, my friends and I organized a bake sale to raise money for feeding orphan children. We also went to visit nursing homes and elderly patients. My family and friends often compliment me on how hard I work and how hard I push myself to achieve my dreams and goals. Along with being detail-oriented, I also carefully make decisions. I always look for the intricacies and perfect them in every project we work on.

             “The gift of service leads to a life of love.” This quote asserts and alludes the importance of volunteering and its positive effects on life and society. Volunteering is a way of helping others and it gives the person the ability to help others that might be in need of their help. Besides, volunteering help in improving social skills by interacting with others in the community. During my school years, I thrived to get as high grades as possible. School grades and my studies were one of my most important priorities at that time. So I didn’t have time to participate in any volunteering projects or events. However, this doesn’t mean that I didn’t try my best in-order to help others personally. I believe that helping others is a necessity in everyone’s life despite the way of helping.
	As for myself, helping others like my parents is a routine work that I can’t relinquish. For example: helping my mother in household chores, supporting my dad in everything he accomplishes to provide us good life and health, praying for my brothers to have future full of success and comfort, and helping my cousins in their studies. Moreover, I never failed in supporting my classmates and friends to understand difficult problems in various subjects at school. When I volunteer and offer help I don’t expect anything in return because I think that it is charitable humanitarian work.
	If I would have the chance to volunteer, it would most likely be helping the UNICEF, our poor brothers and sisters in my homeland Palestine. My dream one day is to visit Palestine and help my people in making big changes for a better life as all of us deserve to live a humanitarian lifestyle in peace and safety. For an example, each Ramadan in Palestine specifically at Al Aqsa mosque, Zionists invade people in the middle of their prayers using gas bombs and weapons. Moreover, many Palestinian refugees that live in refugee camps in Lebanon don’t have the access to food, electricity, medicine, healthcare, and good education. So when I will be financially stable, I want to help as much as possible those people whom are suffering from a lot of devastating circumstances. I want to show the universe that Palestine will rise and strive one day, and the Palestinian people are intelligent. 
	In a nutshell, volunteering is the key to have pure society empty from selfishness and hatred; it makes strong bonds between people and open wide doors for new friendships.  ULYP project is one of the most important and well deserved volunteering scholarship that access to education.  I am forever grateful to have the possibility take this scholarship that help students in fulfilling their dreams by attending universities to have a bright future full of achievements and success. If I want to participate in a volunteering project in the future, I want to be a part of such program similar to ULYP that help Palestinian students to have good education.

First, starting with a project that I was a part of and will never forget. It all started at the end of summer 2021 when I received the opportunity to volunteer at a Special Needs Culinary Academy for 2 weeks. At first, I felt tense and anxious regarding the journey ahead. However, little did I know that these few weeks would turn into a year that would change the course of my life. Though in the beginning, I was being overly cautious and hypervigilant in the fear of any potential harm to the students around me as it was my first experience being fully responsible for teens with special abilities. Later on, however, I slowly started feeling more comfortable and accustomed to them. And that was the beginning of a wonderful story that keeps on astonishing me whenever I remember it.
12 smiles and 12 unforgettable friends that will forever hold a special place in my heart. 
Seeing every aspect of their personalities and behaviors; Their hidden skills, creative minds, and especially their wonderful hearts. Watching their talents improve more and more throughout every activity I had prepared for them, their endless smiles and laughs, celebrating every event with them. While the perfect moments might only be a glimpse of all the hardships and efforts spent to help calm them during anxiety attacks.in addition to learning how to communicate with every single one of them when they are feeling paranoid, teaching them how to deal with their emotions.
Second, another workshop that shaped me into the person I am today was the Lebanese Red Cross awareness workshops where I participated in Youth and Health and YABC sessions, they revolved around how a healthy teenager life should be and how to tackle everyday problems starting from communication skills to teamwork and reaching understanding others points of view, during these 10 sessions I was part of, I made sure to learn as much as possible, socialize and make friends with the rest of the participants and sharing perspectives regarding future majors, universities and daily life problems, all of which was amazing and beneficial in unimaginable ways.
Another Experience would be when I participated for two years in a row in a project that was held by ”Universite Saint Joseph” in which we had to come up in groups with a business that would help serve our country in the midst of an economic crisis and a virus. And there, I made sure to put my best skills to use such as initiative taking, active communication, and understanding other perspectives in order to have effective group work. What I really enjoyed in this project is that it allowed me to channel my inner creativity and meet others and see what kind of ideas and how they were thought of.

Also, the current situation and the half-Palestinian side of me always motivates me to participate in volunteering opportunities. I received work experience in the domain of digital marketing, took part in organizing and planning some events, and I have undertaken programming courses.
In the aftermath of the Beirut port explosion, I with a few of my friends decided to participate in the civic efforts to clean the streets and to support the families of the affected in the port and downtown area. We spent one week trying our best to reduce the pain of people and to provide any help we could for the affected families. Furthermore, I come from a Lebanese father and a Palestinian mother who was later naturalized making me half-Palestinian. I was taught from a young age about the importance of the Palestinian cause and how my grandfather was expelled from Palestine. That’s why during the previous summer I taught English for a group of Palestinian students with Ahlam Lajea Association in Shatila camp.
Furthermore, in the summer of 2021 I worked with a digital transformation company administering social media accounts on Facebook and Instagram responding to clients and engaging in advertising campaings. Working there, I helped manage the accounts of several clients, while scheduling and captioning their posts. All-in-all, I gained experience about digital marketing and all its branches especially that of social media marketing.
As a high-school student with a passion for growth, and principally during the Covid-19 lockdown, I have taken many courses to develop my capabilities. For instance, I received a certificate from New Tech Training center for undertaking a course in Lazarus coding language. Currently, I am enrolled in CS50x, an online course offered by Harvard University which introduces you to the fundamentals of computer science and algorithmic thinking. I intend on taking more courses similar to this one to better prepare myself for a major in CCE.
A couple of weeks ago, our senior class organized an event for the younger classes because of the Holy month of Ramadan. I planned for this event with my peers, gave a speech, and helped with the technical tasks of the event. Also, my sister is a parent coach. So, when she wanted to do parenting workshops in Beirut, I helped her planning it out, and was given admin-related tasks. In addition, I participated in two workshops offered by Global University about Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. 
In conclusion, I try to do a lot of activities other than schoolwork. My Palestinian heritage and the current social difficulties faced by the entirety of Lebanon motivates me to volunteer. I worked in digital marketing during the summer, organized some events, and took part in multiple workshops and courses.

I stand out in my community for being independent, responsible, flexible, amiable, effective at communicating, patient, persistent, and completing deadlines for meetings.

  Despite the fact that the crises have gotten worse over the past four years, we have reduced our involvement in activities, volunteering, and socializing. I take part in the Life Sculptor program as a volunteer with the research team. This team needs its members to gather data on a variety of subjects, and it is our responsibility as volunteers to use that data to create online sessions and workshops. I have been recognized as a second-tier volunteer who has spent more than 40 days working. In addition, I help create awareness campaigns for students at my school about the importance of digital literacy.

  For numerous years, I also took part in the ""open day"" and a number of volunteer activities at my school. Along with taking part in two computer science workshops, I also attended ones on ""All About Medicine,"" ""CRISPR and Gene Editing,"" ""All About Dissociative Disorder,"" ""English Fluency Advanced Level,"" etc.

  Together with my school, I also participated for a cleanup and education campaign on the value of hygiene and its effects on the environment. This campaign has focused on the damaging consequences of pollution on the oceans and marine life, as well as the impact of manufacturing smoke on the atmosphere. I recently took part in a campaign to gather supplies, such as food and clothing, for families impacted by earthquakes in Turkey and Syria.I was also a member of the school parliament for several years and a member of student and school committees to support and defend Palestinian issues and spread awareness about them. 

  In conclusion, volunteering offers a fantastic platform for learning life skills and experiences that people can utilize to decide on their future careers later in life, if they so desire. Volunteers who can change the world are desperately needed by organizations all around the world.

With a mind full of aspirations, I started on my journey of giving back to my community. I took the first step onto the long path ahead of me by signing up and becoming an official member of my school’s community service club. Within a short period of time, I have managed to leave a small imprint on my society.
 
The first project I participated in was being an initiative to spread happiness and joy to disadvantaged children in a public school in Miyeh w Mieyh.. A school visit was done where my fellow club members and I made plenty of donations which included educational games and a laptop that would help in providing the kids with better education. Not only did we give gifts, but we were also able to create a fun atmosphere that made their day brighter and gave them the hope they needed. This project made me realize how important giving back and helping people in need is. 
 
Another project I took part in was collecting donations for the victims of the earthquake in turkey. I collected money donations from students to donate them to turkey and help the citizens affected. I learned a lot from this project and I saw how our help can change lives!

The most recent project was an iftar with orphans. We invited kids over to our school and arranged an iftar for them to enjoy. After breaking our fast, we played and danced with kids. Lastly, we gave them money and toys. I was so happy to be able to draw a smile on their faces!
 
With everything put into perspective, I’m glad to have been given multiple opportunities to fulfill my desire of giving back to the people around me. I hope I get to do even more for larger communities as I grow more independent and capable through my studied and job in the future.

Yes,Female,2023-2024,Yes,No,No,No,Private,Yes,General Sciences - GS,88,85,81,Yes,3 times,"“Who am I?” a question I ask myself daily, and up till this moment, panic grips my throat whenever asked such question. You may be wondering about the reason; well, this is simply because with every new day I live, I learn. With every new experience of my life, and even with every mistake I commit, I learn new things that contribute in discovering a hidden part of my character. Therefore, there isn’t a set response to this question, and there isn’t one description that can sum up who I am entirely either because tomorrow holds new challenges that will transform me and entail the leader in me.
    The term “leadership” holds a great deal of meaning for me. To me, a leader is someone who has a vision and influences others to share that vision. A leader may inspire others to believe that things can be done better, can identify opportunities that others miss, and can assemble a group of people to work together toward a common goal. Thus, a leader is the backbone of the society where efficient communities require great leaders that aspire change and work on collaboration and motivation to give the best out of people and thus reach sustainable and prospered communities. 
    Today, I can proudly call myself a young leader for a small society in the city I live in where I’ve contributed in helping my community by taking every possible opportunity.  I’ve volunteered in distributing food for the unprivileged people as well as being a logistics member in the event of “Acts of Talent” that was organized by Rotaract Club and Interact Clubs of Saida, which I can happily call myself a member of. The aim of the event was to provide therapy sessions for unprivileged kids who needed it during such hard times. Additionally, I had the pleasure to plan an event by being the head of entertainment of the flawless event “Ta3o Neshar Sawa 2.0” that had an aim of covering tuitions for 40 unprivileged kids in Saida. Leading the entire entertainment committee made me feel like a leader where motivating other members to work hard and give all their potentials to have a very entertaining and successful event made me feel like a leader. In fact, the success of this event and perceiving 40 students receive their education motivated me to further serve my community and participate in other community service activities in my city. Being parts of such events that hold an amazing goal has added to my personality a lot where I have acquired lifelong leadership skills that I will forever be grateful for. Additionally, I have participated in my school’s MUN conference where I got the chance to develop my research, communication, leadership, and public speaking skills and thus develop my personality to become the person I am today. 
   In conclusion, leadership in my community and volunteer work can have a significant positive impact on both myself and those around me. It enables everyone to learn new talents, get priceless experience, and alter the world for the better. I may encourage and empower others to give back to their communities through volunteering and leadership roles, sparking a positive chain reaction. Every act of service and leadership, whether it is volunteering for a neighborhood charity or planning an event for the community, counts.

It is giving a person’s time and ability to help someone who may be in need of help. Not only does volunteering help others, but what they may not know is that it can be helpful to them. It is a great way for someone to interact with others in their community. It gives someone that time to themselves while also creating bonds when they are doing the greater good. The effects of volunteering can range from many helpful characteristics. From helping those in need, giving back to the community, working for worthwhile causes, and overall helping someone with their health, mentally and physically. Volunteering is when you freely offer to do something without pay. In a person’s life, they have at least participated in community service one time. For some people, volunteering helps them feel like they play an essential role while they are giving back to their community. Although volunteering is purely an act of kindness, it can also be very helpful in some people’s lives, such as making them feel like they are the difference makers. Volunteering teaches valuable lessons that can be applied to real, everyday life, which makes volunteering beneficial for all ages.
I’m currently a volunteer in the Lebanese Red Cross and in an Orphans NGO besides helping the elderly. For me helping and developing humanitarian traits is way to express myself. Seeing and feeling the happiness of others, fighting for someone’s rights, and helping people stay alive and in good conditions that make me feel happy. Seeing all of that makes me well bonded with life and not question my existence. I may be one single person fighting for change but what I know well is that I’m making change in the place I am in. 
In addition to that, I believe that if I made a change from where I am now and developed my abilities millions of people that have the same thoughts and goals will help in their places which help mature and develop the world to a world full of humanity.

At Islamic Welfare Association, I have had the opportunity to work on several projects and initiatives aimed at supporting vulnerable communities in Lebanon. One of my favorite projects was buying Eid outfits for orphans and people in need. It was heartwarming to see the joy and excitement on the children's faces as they received their new clothes, and I felt grateful to be a part of such a meaningful effort. Additionally, planning and participating in entertainment activities for children, such as arts and crafts, storytelling, and games, was incredibly rewarding. It felt wonderful to be able to bring a little bit of joy and fun into their lives, even if just for a few hours. Lastly, distributing food parcels in areas such as Saida, Aarsal, and Bekaas was an eye-opening experience that helped me understand the challenges that people in these communities face on a daily basis. I feel proud to have been able to contribute to efforts aimed at alleviating some of the burden they carry. Recently, I joined the Saida Initiative Debates Club, which has been a great way for me to develop my critical thinking and public speaking skills. Each month, I participate in debates on a variety of topics, including politics, culture, and social issues. This experience has challenged me to think more deeply about my beliefs and to articulate them in a clear and persuasive way. I believe that these skills will be useful to me in a variety of contexts, both personal and professional. Finally, I worked on a project with Islamic Welfare Association about the status of refugees in Lebanon (I have shared my experience on my Instagram account @jana.elsolh). We conducted interviews with refugees living in different parts of the country to better understand their experiences and challenges. This project gave me a greater appreciation for the struggles that refugees face, and also helped me develop my research and communication skills.  I am also a member of the Muslim Scouts of Lebanon. This organization provides a unique opportunity for me to combine my love for the outdoors with my desire to give back to my community. As a scout, I have participated in several camping trips and outdoor activities, which have helped me develop leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.

I have participated in many workshops of all kinds, which helped me to get to know more about many people and understand people’s nature.  One of the most beautiful courses that i participated in was the first aid course, and the reason I loved it so much is because it taught me how to benefit others, and perhaps I will be in a position and save the life of one or more people, which is considered a very beautiful humanitarian work. In this course, I learned how to deal with accidents , rescuing the affected, dealing with cases of skin burns or cases of suffocation, in addition to how to deal with an unconscious person or even cases of suffocation, in addition to how to act in all these cases and under the strong pressure that the paramedic faces.  Also, I have participated in many group workshops such as: Robotics Workshop, Entrepreneurship Workshop, and Cooking Workshop.  In the robotics workshop, I learned some secret keys in “cooding” and how to make some sensors or machines respond to the code written on the computer screen. This topic aroused my interest because it is related to computer science. As for the entrepreneurship course, I took courses on how to start  with a project and what are the steps that I have to check and the skills that I have to learn before starting the project, and I would really like to start a project of making protein chocolate bars that a large section of bodybuilders would accept, but I was flattered to leave this idea because of academic pressure  but as soon as I get the opportunity, I will start working on the project.  As for the cooking course, most of the work was on the basis of dealing with customers, how to dialogue with them, the basics of personal hygiene, and certainly the methods of preparing some meals. At the end of the project, we prepared about fifty meals and distributed them to the needy.  There is another workshop, which is the barbering course, where we also learned the etiquette of dealing with customers and the basics of personal hygiene, but this course did not interest me much because I do not see that this profession is commensurate with my personal characteristics.",1,"Lebanese American University (LAU), Rafik Hariri University (RHU)",No,Divorced,Yes,No,No,No,No,0,No,Done,Done,915,Eligible,Considered,Expenses Higher,0,TRUE,1,Avg,working group wonderful thing contributes greatly human development participated many workshop kind helped get know many people understand people ’ nature one beautiful course participated first aid course reason loved much taught benefit others perhaps position save life one people considered beautiful humanitarian work course learned deal accident rescuing affected dealing case skin burn case suffocation addition deal unconscious person even case suffocation addition act case strong pressure paramedic face also participated many group workshop robotics workshop entrepreneurship workshop cooking workshop robotics workshop learned secret key “ cooding ” make sensor machine respond code written computer screen topic aroused interest related computer science entrepreneurship course took course start project step check skill learn starting project would really like start project making protein chocolate bar large section bodybuilder would accept flattered leave idea academic pressure soon get opportunity start working project cooking course work basis dealing customer dialogue basic personal hygiene certainly method preparing meal end project prepared fifty meal distributed needy another workshop barbering course also learned etiquette dealing customer basic personal hygiene course interest much see profession commensurate personal characteristic,0.167981722,Nothing,0,2,0,6,1,0,0,0,2

One of my most memorable workshop experiences was with Model Arab League, which was an incredibly enriching and eye-opening experience. The Model Arab League is a simulation of the Arab League, in which students from various schools come together to represent member states and engage in debates and discussions on important regional issues.
During the workshop, I had the opportunity to represent a member state and engage in various debates and discussions with other students. The topics ranged from economic and social issues to political and diplomatic matters. Through these debates, I learned to think critically about complex issues and to develop well-informed and well-reasoned arguments.
In addition to the debates, the workshop also included various training sessions and workshops on topics such as public speaking, diplomacy, and negotiation. These sessions were incredibly valuable in helping me to develop my communication and leadership skills, as well as my ability to work collaboratively with others.One of the most rewarding aspects of the workshop was the opportunity to meet and work with other like-minded students from various universities. I was inspired by their passion and dedication to making a positive impact in the world, and I learned a lot from their diverse perspectives and experiences. It allowed me also to develop my critical thinking, communication, and leadership skills, as well as to broaden my understanding of regional issues and perspectives.

In addition to volunteering, I have also been involved in various clubs and organizations throughout my academic career. One of my favorite clubs was a writing club in school, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with other students on creative writing projects and participate in writing contests. This club allowed me to develop my writing skills and explore new genres and styles of writing.

Moreover, I had the opportunity to participate in a Spelling Bee contest, which was an incredibly challenging yet rewarding experience. The contest involved spelling words correctly from a given list, and it was open to students from various grade levels.Leading up to the contest, I spent hours studying and memorizing the spelling list, as well as learning new words and their meanings. I also worked on improving my pronunciation and enunciation, as I knew that these were important factors in spelling correctly.Participating in the Spelling Bee contest was an incredibly enriching experience for me as a student. It taught me the importance of hard work and preparation, as well as the value of perseverance and determination. It also helped me to develop my language skills and expand my vocabulary, which has been valuable in my academic pursuits.

My parents don't allow me to participate always with NGO's, because of that I started to mentor students through Whatsapp and I helped some school students in different subjects as well.What makes me special outside of my school work is my drive and commitment to making a positive impact in my community and the world around me. I believe that it is important to use my skills and resources to help others and to make a difference in the lives of those who are less fortunate. I am also passionate about learning and growing as an individual, and I am always seeking out new opportunities to challenge myself and develop new skills.

Overall, my involvement in volunteering projects, events, campaigns, workshops, and clubs has allowed me to make a positive impact on my community, develop new skills, and explore my passions outside of my academic pursuits. It is my hope that these experiences will continue to shape me into a well-rounded and compassionate individual who is committed to making a difference in the world.

  The first volunteering activity for me was three years ago, when me and a small group of teens started collecting money from houses and stores in our City, and allocating this money in buying clothes for orphans. In addition, I participated in distribution of food parcels and hot meals at refugees camps in Akkar, in addition to giving medical tools and medicines to different pharmacies in Saida, Tyre, Beirut and Chime. I also participated in orphans activities in a park that consists of many areas for playing games, eating food and drawing.
  Moreover, there is a special volunteering day that was my favorite one which is visiting Cancer patients from kids, adults and elderly people, and distributing clothes, blankets and toys, this day was so emotional especially when seeing those patients feeling happy and making them forget their pain.
   Therefore, I volunteered in a restaurant specialized for families that are having financial difficulties, this restaurant opens especially in Ramadan Month, it is fully funded by donors in an NGO at saida, and in this restaurant we prepared the food in addition to the dessert, then distributed the hot meals to the families to eat, that was an amazing experience!
   I also strive to improving my personality and social skills, I participated in a ""Social Activator"" workshop is centered around learning how to be an activator in the community and how to make an impactful difference in it, also I attended a First Aid training with a medical organization and learned about how to relief others. I also attended a training about Covid-19 virus and its vaccine and how to avoid the rumors that are spreaded in the community around the vaccine. Also, a part of my life was in participating with scouts, I learned many life skills at scouts, and this includes attending workshops about leadership which benefited me.

I also believe that doing good for people in my community is a must and not a choice as our community won’t develop if we don’t help each other.
Because of my beliefs and convictions, I have participated in the community service project in my school. I have played the role of cashier through my service. I was chosen for this position by my team and our coordinator since they find me impartial, responsible, and good in math. Through this project, we have made a lot of services including: helping a poor student to pay tuition fees of his school. We have brought money for him through applying different activities in our school including matches and bake sales. In addition to that, we have collected old clothes from all students in our school. After that we have classified them according to gender and size then distributed them to poor people.

Have you ever visited someone in the hospital? Have you ever helped in social sectors such as an orphanage, a local library, or a homeless shelter?
There are many ways to give back to the society you have spent your life in.
In the following, I will be talking about several volunteering activities I have taken part in.
First of all, I have volunteered at the social club in my town. I was in charge of this for several years. We had a local community group that volunteered to supply the food and deliver it to people with debilitating illnesses that couldn't shop or cook for themselves.
Sometimes, we have worked with homeless people and helped them get a job.
When you meet these people, it hits hard to see  how they are working to get their lives back together. 
That first experience opened me up to a new perspective. I started seeing the world through the eyes of the people I am helping. In addition, in March 2022, I composed a poem ""I was fifteen when left my country” and it was chosen by the Lebanese national library to be included in their annual books. Meanwhile, I went to UNESCO in Hamra to sign the book in the presence of the Minister of Culture Dr. Mohamed El Majzoub. This experience reflected my work ethic and my perseverance. 
On the other hand, I volunteered at the public library in my hometown. As far, it was one of my favorite experiences. It introduced me to people, and it showed me how privileged I am. In the library, our team got connected with kids so well. We celebrated their birthdays together, and we had small parties where they performed their skills like dancing and acting.
I still remember kids hugging me and requesting me not to leave. This voluntary service has benefited me enormously.
In my view, school was always a place where talents are hidden. My love to help others and put a smile on people’s faces was always my priority.
However, I have always been a believer in using time as wisely and positively as possible.
And I feel this is what makes me unique.
Now that I think back upon all the volunteering that I have done, it makes me happy to think about all the friends I have made along the way to helping significant causes.
I once took volunteering to change the world, but then I realized that volunteering has changed me. I learned to think about others before I think about myself.
Besides, I understood the harsh reality of life because of volunteering.
You don't need to move mountains for it. It is as simple as helping a blind person to cross the road.

I have been part of several outside activities that have provided me with unforgettable experiences and valuable lessons.

I have always been passionate about sports and have enjoyed both playing and watching games for as long as I can remember. During my high school years, I decided to join the football team. That decision not only allowed me to improve my physical fitness and athletic abilities but also taught me valuable lessons about teamwork, communication, and leadership. As a member of the team, I learned how to effectively communicate with my teammates and how to work together towards a common goal. I also discovered the importance of leadership and how it can be used to motivate and encourage others. These skills have proved to be incredibly valuable in many aspects of my life, including my personal relationships and professional endeavors. Whether it's working on a group project, managing a team, or simply communicating with others, the lessons I learned on the football field have helped me become a more effective and successful individual.

Giving back to the community is something that I find fulfilling. I have volunteered at a local charity organization that helps underprivileged children. Volunteering has taught me to be more empathetic, compassionate, and grateful. It has also given me the opportunity to meet people from different backgrounds and to learn about their experiences.

Being part of outside activities has been a significant part of my life. It has taught me valuable skills and lessons that have helped me grow as a person.

Once I was a member of the crew of the “Prisoner” I noticed everything. I saw how a series is shot with its all preparations. The importance of this series was shown by its action events and its crew where all of them were professionals and experienced people. My role was to help the sound engineer, and it was a hard task because it was the first time to enter a set and work with a person from Tunisia. 
       After introducing myself to the engineer, I told him that I didn’t have any experience, but I watched some videos about the work of sound engineers and memorized the name of the equipment he used. He noticed that I was a person who had the will to learn when he saw me taking pictures and a video of everything in the cart even the way of preparing it and making it ready for him which made me feel more comfortable. Starting from my second day I used to come before the engineer for 1 or 2 hours just to prepare the cart and the boom and put the batteries on the charge to prove myself and show that I could finish my task to its fullest. 
       That work was fatiguing because I woke up at 5:00 pm and I didn’t come the home before 8:00 pm. However, I tried my best to learn new things as much as I could so once I had a break from working with the engineer or when I finish everything requested, I went to the team of the camera and helped them. Everyone on the set thought that I didn’t have less than 2 years of experience because of my activity. When anyone asked me about the number of films or series I participated in and I told him/her that this was the first one, they were shocked. Once the photographer of Geno Media told me that I was the youngest one on that set everyone there had a minimum of 3 years of experience and some people had a rank in the world.
      On the last day of work, everyone on the set commended my work even the director was amazed. At that time, I noticed that I was a fast learner, and I had the ability to leave a beautiful trail wherever I go.

Participating in such activities is a substantial element of every special student's identity. Personally, it has been an honor and a pleasure to have played a part in serving my community and building my persona. The following essay highlights the most remarkable workshops and courses that I have attended and the voluntary work I have done in community service to get to a conclusion of what part they play in making me special outside of my academic life. 

To begin with, I have completed four workshops for developing leadership skills as a first step to becoming a true leader at Haigazian University in collaboration with WAZNAT, which were divided into four Saturdays. They included educational presentations, splendid teamwork activities, and socialization. Moreover, I have completed 10 workshops for raising awareness about dangerous behavior in society, which mainly took place at my school (Collège Dominicaines de Notre Dame de la Délivrande) as part of a program given by Mentor Arabia. They included educational presentations, challenging and intriguing teamwork activities, and personal assessment tests. Last but not least, I have completed more than 10 workshops in the last two months that varied from one for eating disorders (BioSets), one for creative writing (Life Sculpture), one for learning about malware (Life Sculpture), one about peer pressure (Life Sculpture), and many more. 

In addition, I have completed more than 100 hours of community service during the last two years. First, I completed a self-made event at Cornish Sawfar that lasted for a total of 48 hours in collaboration with the municipality of Sawfar. It included teamwork activities to clean the environment of the Cornish in order to benefit the community, help nature, motivate people to participate in community service, and raise their awareness about polluting the beautiful area. Later on, I completed a program in Sawfar, organized by the municipality of Sawfar and me, that also lasted a total of 48 hours. It included events and activities to gather help for the less fortunate families in the region in order to support them financially and psychologically in these difficult times. Finally, I have done activities with Mentor Arabia at school and in Aley that have helped me learn how to help the people in our community who are engaging in dangerous and self-harming behaviors.

In conclusion, everything that has been mentioned indicates that those events played a major role in my social life and helped me become the person I am today. I value them above everything else because they made me build emotional intelligence, become more responsible, humane, and educated, not to mention how they turned me into a humanitarian and completely changed my personality traits and my character. The fact that all this self-development and awareness was done without any academic purposes shows what makes me a special person, noting that my ambitions and plans are far more than that.

As a member of the research team, we conduct information about diverse topics that tackle crucial issues in our world, for it to be presented through online free sessions. Furthermore, I’ve attended two workshops held at the American University of Beirut (AUB) under the titles “Future Entrepreneurs” and “Up to the Challenge” this summer. Despite their short duration, the two workshops were highly beneficial, as they provided me with lots of information about the business administration major and an overview of this discipline and its world. in addition to that, it escalated my communication skills by meeting new people. Also, getting to work with peers in a team and exchanging ideas was a great experience.  Other than that, I have been part of several social initiatives raised for a good cause.

In school, my academic performance makes me stand out, and outside of it, my personality is what makes me stand out. Because whether I’m a student or not, I’m above all a human.

It was a three - day virtual camping which lasts four hours each day.
The leaders of the event organized exciting activities , lectures and songs.
The first day was precised for lectures that provide background information about Al Masjid Al Aqsa. They displayed maps and pictures for the inside and outside of All Masjid, and spoke about the historical and architectural value. In the second day there were interactional activities in which we could ask , answer and work with the members in different activities. The third day was for reflecting on this virtual experience, to what extent it was useful, what skills and information were acquired. We also listened to songs as a part of celebrating the event.

It is giving a person time and the ability to help someone who may need help. Not only does volunteering help others, but what they may not know is that it can be helpful to themselves. It is a great way for someone to interact with others in their community. It gives someone that time to themselves while also creating bonds when they are doing the greater good. The effects of volunteering can range from many helpful characteristics. From helping those in need, giving back to the community, working for worthwhile causes, and overall helping someone with their health, mentally and physically. 

 Six months ago, I had a volunteering project for kids in our school. My friends and I had to create a project that entertains Grade 1 students as well as expands their spectrum of knowledge. Everyone made a project on specific subjects. Some people made physics and biology projects, others made math and chemistry, and a few people made English and Arabic projects. I was the only one to make a geography project. I made them a game that was called guess the flag. With each correct guess, students get a piece of chocolate. We made it like a festival, put some music on, and brought them delicious food to entertain them. Our main goal from this festival was to bring joy to these little kids and enrich them with knowledge. Fortunately, our goal was accomplished. Every kid that came to the festival was filled with joy and happiness and they benefited a lot from it. Not only did they enjoy the festival, but I also did. The feeling you get when you see these kids smiling can’t be described. Moreover, this festival helped me a lot. It improved my communication skills and provided me with a healthy boost to my self-confidence, self-esteem, and life satisfaction. In addition, it gave me a sense of purpose and achievement. I felt like I did something really important for the community. 

Another volunteering experience I participated in was around 1 year ago. I was included in a group that had to organize a festival for the kids in my neighborhood in a park. What we basically did is set up different activities at different corners and sites of the park. For example, a certain site of the park was used to create a street football field. Another site was used to form a basketball field and another was site was used for kids who want to participate in trivia questions and mental games. such volunteering experiences are joyful because even though you don't get money for helping someone, you get the joy and happiness of knowing you did something good for someone else.

We sterilized the hands of entering and leaving people and gave masks to people who did not have one, we also measured their temperature.

I have also had a programming course where we learned how to use MIT App developer to program apps. We were also taught a lot about the programming world in general. I worked in a group with my friends on some ideas we had and I was given a certificate at the end of the course.

I've always been passionate about giving back to the community and making a positive impact on the world, so I've participated in a variety of projects, events, campaigns, workshops, and clubs over the years.

One of my most meaningful volunteering experiences was when I helped out at a local homeless shelter. I assisted with meal prep, served food, organized donations, and provided support and company to the residents. It was a humbling experience, and it taught me the importance of empathy, kindness, and gratitude.

Another project that I'm particularly proud of is a community service event that I organized with some of my friends. We collected donations of school supplies and backpacks for underprivileged children in our community, and then distributed them at a local back-to-school event. It was a wonderful experience, and we were able to help many children start the school year off on the right foot.

Overall, my volunteering and extracurricular activities reflect my passion for making a difference, my curiosity and willingness to learn new things, and my ability to work collaboratively with others.

Therefore, it is clear that school helps in building human personality, but actually the academic experience is not enough to build a successful human who can do his tasks, help others and cooperate with them, and be an influential person at his community.
I consider that time outside school is just as important as time inside school, a student with impressive academic potentials but without social skills is just like a man with impressive tools but he doesn’t know how to use them.

According to what I mentioned before, I payed attention to my time and I tried to take advantage of every chance I have to improve my social skills.So, I joined Zad Academy, which is a non-profit organization in Saida that aims to help children and youth in their academic journey and to organize winter and summer camps. It improves the students’ social skills and their personalities by lessons and activities like: reading books, watching purposeful videos, and  playing mind games… . Since I was child I was a student at this academy, I showed my potentials at this academy,  I was always superior at the activities and I was polite. After several years of being a student, the academy administrators asked me to be a volunteer with them and to be responsible for the youngest level (7-9 years), and here my journey began. At that place, I have evolved and  benefited a lot  from the experienced volunteers, I learnt how to deal with children, how to discuss with them about their obstacles and how to solve them. I recognized that I’m a role model so I have to pay attention to what I do, I still remember that time when a student came to the academy wearing a watch that looks like a watch I wore before. After I learnt, gained experience, and improved, I showed my leadership and creativity skills, even one time when a volunteer was absent I played his role and created a new activity. 

Also my extracurricular activities didn’t stop here, I joined a project that distribute the food for families in need, everyone at the team was responsible for his role, someone cook, other one prepare the meals…. my position was to hold the meals and deliver them to the families. With this team, I proved my leadership skills, I don’t mean that I was the administrator for this project, but because I did my tasks very well, everyone who plays his role is a leader. Also I showed high discipline.

I see that, outside my school work, I’m distinguished  at finding a solution for every problem that face my team, my ability to monitor what is going on, and my speed to take the right decision make me special.

But as much as I am proud of these activities, they didn’t have that big of an impact on my life. Then what are the things that really made a change? What are some qualities that make me “me”?
I’ve been in scouts for 10 years now, and not only does it feel like my second home, but something I will always cherish in my heart. I’ve developed there many skills such as teamwork, courageousness, leadership, planning, time management, and many other qualities. Usually, we do volunteer work, such as aiding older people - whether it be providing their needs or helping them get rid of a burden. We also clean streets from time to time and organize many activities in our village on special occasions like Christmas and Easter. Not to mention the camps we plan all over Lebanon where we learn many cultural things about other towns and villages. I’ve done ACMAS (abacus center for mental arithmetic system) for many years and gained many abilities such as concentration, photographic memory, visualization, listening skill, and others. I participated in many competitions there and got 2 certificates. I think that time was the proudest I’ve ever been because I always doubted my abilities in ACMAS, it was a boost of confidence for me. I had a training session at Red Cross. Among the many things I learned was how to handle a dangerous situation such as performing CPR, controlling bleeding… This year I’m in a club called “Club Social “(Social club), and its main purpose is to help and engage in our society. The last activity we did was painting the walls of the classrooms. We did not only assist our school, but it was also very educational.
Engaging in our society is something I have always been afraid of and especially since I’m more of an introvert than an extrovert. Yet, while writing this, it makes me feel grateful for all the activities I was part of through the years.

Growing up, I received undeniable world-changing help from the people surrounding me, whether it was family members or friends. As a result, a desire grew within me to first develop my skills outside the school curriculum and then give back to my community.
Acting upon this desire to help others, I joined several activities that helped me give back to my community and strengthen the skills I needed for my future area of work. In the summer of 2020, I joined a local NGO called Aljana, which offered fascinating programming courses that made me realize my passion and gave me the chance to excel in it. After finishing the courses which varied from life skills to creating apps and making small robots, I helped them organize local events aimed at tightening bonds within the community by setting up cultural food stands and performances open to all families present. In 11th grade, I participated in several Model United Nations (MUN) events, which significantly developed my critical thinking, research, and debate skills. Shortly after, I became the president of my committee in my school's MUN for two years in a row, submitting multiple research papers on current world issues and overlooking the entire process. As I watched myself grow throughout MUN, I decided to pass on my experiences and skills by training lower classes prepare them for future MUN events. 
My initiatives towards helping people around me grow didn’t stop there, however, for I used all the skills I had personally acquired and channeled them into my school’s community service club as its leader, organizing events, workshops, and fundraising events which attracted a great portion of students both and inside and outside the club. Put simply, I see myself lifting my future communities up as I myself grow within my field of study, for all that’s missing is the helping hand that will extend to give me the opportunity to pursue it.

Additionally, I have been actively involved in an NGO that provides support and assistance to individuals struggling with drug addiction. It was both heart-wrenching and heartwarming to witness their journey towards recovery, and being a part of their support system was a truly meaningful experience.

I have also taken several arduino workshops and participated in competitions at RHU. The ability to learn new technical skills and apply them in practical settings has been incredibly fulfilling, and it has furthered my passion for innovation and technology.

Furthermore, I have participated in Model United Nations at LAU and HHHS. It was a fantastic opportunity to expand my knowledge of international affairs and diplomacy and develop my public speaking skills through engagement in thought-provoking debates with like-minded individuals.

Back in the summer of 2022, I applied as a volunteer for a computer science club under iCademy called CompSci, after I've attended one of their sessions. I remember researching what PR meant, minutes before the interview. I have, in my spontaneous moment of excitement, applied for a position I had no idea about. Good thing is, I found out I actually liked it! The list of traits that make a good PR were so me. I took a deep breath and joined. The lady who interviewed me was the founder of the club, her voice was warm and gentle, it made me feel at ease. Throughout the interview, she asked me the typical questions of ""tell me about yourself"" alongside the more technical questions like ""what programming languages do you know?"" and asked me to show her some of my code projects. She seemed pretty satisfied so we soon signed a contract. And the journey began. At first, I thought it wouldn't take much time and energy but due to the lack of volunteers, I found myself taking on several roles at once. And it's not like I was forced to. I just believed in the potential of this club so much that I was willing to give it my all. What really touched me though was the fact that I saw the impact it had on students, including my friends whom I've recommended to attend the sessions. Learning how to code is a very essential skill in today's world and I have struggled to find free resources at the time when I was learning myself. The passion fuelled me to work harder than ever before. I designed posts, managed our social media accounts, registered students, created feedback forms, took attendance, assembled weekly reports, and used all my persuasion skills when the founder told me she decided to give up on it. I was devastated. This club was my baby, and while I supported her aspirations and her goals, I, personally wasn't ready to let go yet. So I stayed. The club was transferred to LifeSculptor, another NGO. This was a rough phase for CompSci. But I had to keep believing. Few months in, we got a new founder. Straight away, he scheduled a meeting to get to know more about the club. As the oldest volunteer, I had a lot to say. Surprisingly, he heard me out and even implemented some of the solutions I suggested, the same week! That was promising. Afterwards, it was a period of working hard to repair the club and recruiting more amazing people on the way. As part of the management team, we really managed to make this club a success.

           Being engaged in the society and applying several activities within it is an important role in which any person ought to try these experiences to enhance his interaction with the society. There are a lot of projects anyone can perform in the sake of being interactive in the community in order to enhance it like volunteering, attending events, participating in workshops and clubs, etc... I have experienced all of the above activities and would like to share some of it.



            I consider volunteering an essential activity that must be experienced and fulfilled by every person in the society. Our life is meaningful by cooperation. This year, I volunteered in an organization called ""Development and Right charity association in Lebanon"" this organization is located in ketermaya in Lebanon. In this charitable organization my positioned aimed to distribute baskets of food to the needy families. I really enjoyed this volunteering project by feelias I took some of the problems of the society aside, even if I did a little, that can be valuable to many people and by cooperation we can ensure better fate.



          Participating in workshops took the first place in my life the first year. I participated in 4 significant workshops at ""Al-Jana organization"". The first one was robotics, in this workshop I learned about electronics and programming by using arduino as a programming device in addition to laptop to provide some specific codes. At the end of this workshop I got the ability to invent an electronic car with some sensors which are well coded by me to direct its motion with some features. The second workshop was about application development, this workshop aimed to teach how to use Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, creating Google forms, and Microsoft excel. This workshop was one of the best workshops I have ever taken for its vast importance in my daily life especially while preparing projects for school and researchs.
        


       Being special outside the school is a fundamental concept. One of the things that make me special is my respectful treatment with all the people around me and honestly non of the people have showed any type of upset towards me because of an action or manner yet. I addition to my readiness to serve any person need my help. Another thing is the free lessons which I perform in order to help my friends especially before exams.

I always knew that I wanted to make a positive change in my community, but I didn't know where to start alone. I needed something that would give me direction, where I could work with people that address all segments of society without exception or discrimination. That was the main reason I decided to join a scout. Through many teamwork activities and tasks I took on, I was able to work on core leadership qualities such as proper communication skills, confidence and a problem-solving mentality. It also allowed me to aid underprivileged people in my community from foster kids to adults that are incapable of getting their basic needs. One experience from the scout I will never forget was on the 4th of August when the tragic explosion happened in Beirut. We were able to aid those affected by the explosion, help repair the damaged buildings and clean up the streets. I've always wanted to help my community ever since I was a little kid, so in seeing people suffering from the explosion,  as hard as it was for me to mentally comprehend, I couldn't stand and do anything. I promised myself to take advantage of every opportunity that will help me improve my society and community. I've also participated in an activity organized by the Muslim scout for the foster kids in the orphanage in Sidon. This activity included several performances such as a magician and a music band with the presence of the Malaysian ambassador and a number of the united nations. The ability to help someone in need gives me overwhelming happiness and a sense of love and empathy.
Volunteering has helped me create a beautiful bond with the volunteers. I met great people and gained more friends for life. It has helped me be more social and given me a passion to play a significant role in my community and society. Also during the holy month of Ramadan, I participated in the scout kitchen to prepare the iftar for people in need. Every day during this month, several volunteers participate to help in the process of making food and distributing them. This kind of support and aid motivates me to tell my friends and family members to join me in helping people.

I participate in a play talking about how to recycle, reduce, and reuse. I played the role of grandmother. Also, I participate in a campaign for collecting money for in need people. I remember a presentation I did with my friends about different cultures each one of us wore traditional clothes from many different countries and we spoke about each one of these cultures. I visited “Deir Taanayel” where recycling projects took place, and then we wrote essays about it.

There's nothing better than getting involved in my community. Volunteering allows me to change people's lives, including mine. It gives me the satisfaction of playing an important role in someone else's life. I consider volunteering a way to give back to my community, in addition to the important social skills and valuable experiences that it had taught me. Therefore, I love getting involved in the community often. I feel as if I'm doing one of the functions required for a healthy community.

Working at Al Riaayah may have been the best decision I could have ever made. Especially that one time I went to the Riaayah restaurant during Ramadan and helped the staff with welcoming the elders, preparing their tables, and packing food to distribute them. In addition to participating in a recycling project to raise awareness and teach people in Saida how to recycle organic and non-organic wastes. I, and a group of volunteers, visited almost every house in Saida and informed people about the recycling plan that the organization was making.

One of the best volunteering projects I’ve participated in is the “Blue Mission” project for COVID-19 vaccination. Where we were required to learn everything about COVID-19 and the different types of vaccines, to go to vaccination centers to inform people about them, and to correct every misconception spreading about the vaccine. In addition to helping with the vaccination process in hospitals throughout Lebanon. This didn’t only help me earn knowledge, but it has taught me how to be patient when it comes to communicating with people of different ages. In addition to the friends that I have made and the self-confidence that I have earned.

Last year, I decided to make a group with my friends to especially raise awareness in our school. Our first project was to raise awareness about bullying, its effect on society and individuals, and how to prevent it. We managed to go through more than 10 classes and make several activities and workshops regarding this topic. The project was successful and organized; it can be said that we made a great impact on the students and we managed to deliver the idea that we wanted to fulfill.

My volunteering experience throughout the years taught me the great importance of gratitude. I started to appreciate all the things I have in my life.

That's why I actively participated in various volunteering activities, projects, workshops, and events that allowed me to gain valuable skills while making a positive impact on the lives of others.

One of the events that stood out for me was the debate on Anti-sectarianism organized by USAID at the American University of Beirut. This event was a great learning experience for me, as it taught me the importance of effective communication and the ability to embrace other points of view. I learned how to argue my point effectively while still respecting the opinions of others. This event allowed me to develop my critical thinking skills and broaden my perspective on various issues.

Another memorable experience for me was when I joined Diyarouna NGO for a camp. During this camp, we participated in various awareness activities that taught us about cooperation, sharing, independence, and leadership skills. We were encouraged to work together to achieve common goals and learned the importance of teamwork. Through this experience, I was able to develop my leadership skills and learn how to motivate and inspire others.

I also had the opportunity to volunteer with Nabaa NGO, where I helped organize activities for children, taught and played with them, and assisted in teaching Syrian refugees. This experience allowed me to develop my communication skills while helping others in need. I found it rewarding to see the smiles on the children's faces and to know that I was making a positive impact on their lives.

Furthermore, I attended a workshop organized by Generation Hope NGO, which provided me with the skills to be an effective leader. During this workshop, I learned how to communicate my ideas effectively, how to manage a team, and how to inspire others to achieve their goals. These skills have helped me become a more effective leader in both my personal and professional life.

Lastly, I participated in an online session organized by UNICEF about child violence and electronic violence. This session was an eye-opener for me as it highlighted the importance of raising awareness about the negative impact of electronic violence on children. It also taught me how to be an advocate for children's rights and how to work towards creating a safer environment for them.

But also gaining leadership potential is not something simple. It is associated with numerous skills involving problem-solving, decision-making, and most importantly communication. Building a powerful personality is not easy. It requires being wise, smart, persistent, independent, resilient, and most importantly a curious learner. I have the privilege to tell you about some of the extracurricular activities I participated in during the past three years.

Starting with the Fundamentals of Neuroscience, an online program offered by edx.org in
collaboration with the Harvard Institute. The duration of this program is 6 months and
it is comprised of three distinct courses each coding for a specific topic. The first is
the electrical properties of the neuron. The second is Neurons and networks in
addition to providing information related to neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.
The third course is related to the brain and how we perceive the world through our
senses and their interpretation in our brain... Thus, this program presents the needed
information about Neuroscience and gives the student a great idea about the field. As well as I participated in another neuroscience workshop with Icademy which introduced participants to the main roles of the nervous system and the structure and function of the nervous system parts and introduces students to the importance of reflexology and myelination and how different parts of the nervous system can function altogether to form one unit. Upon finishing the whole program I earned three accredited certificates and one for completion and I passed my final exams with high grades. Moreover, another activity I participated in was Tech for Change, the project's objective was to prepare 26 Beirut public high school girls to take part in the fourth industrial revolution through hands-on Python coding labs and women in STEM mentorship sessions. This program was offered by the AUB USAID scholars
to emphasize the importance of the STEM field and teach students a new programming language namely Python. Furthermore, I was actively participating in the Techsplore Program 2022, a 3 days long program offered by All Girls Code, an initiative that started with AUB scholars. This program targets youth especially girls who are interested in the STEM field and it includes workshops about Tableau Software and the basics of HTML/CSS and C programming languages well as mentorship sessions about volunteering, motivation, and CV/internship preparation. Additionally, one of the unforgettable experiences I gained was at the American University of Beirut where I participated in a special workshop named Up to the Challenge workshop. The main target of this program was to start a competition between 11 teams
where a freestanding body is to be built using simple materials including 20
spaghetti strands, a thread, tape, and a marshmallow. Other challenges were
done between the competitors where each member had to manifest his/her
leadership potential to accomplish a desired task. Analytical thinking, problem-solving, decision-making, creativity, ideation, pitching, and many other skills were
mandatory for bringing out the best results in this workshop. Another activity I enjoyed was with Shabablab, an online program that entailed both self-paced modules and google meet sessions. The target of this program was to emphasize the importance of innovation
especially social innovation where youth are introduced to environmental SDGs. As a participant (and a webpreneur), I had to choose one environmental SDG and 
dive deeper into the problems associated with this SDG. Furthermore, we had to work
on one problem which was burning waste due to improper recycling in
Beirut/Lebanon. We developed a web guide where sustainable solutions for the
problem are mentioned clearly. Last but not least, I was the manager of my team and
I held the priority in decision-making and distributing tasks equally among all team
members. Thus, it was a great experience that gave me the opportunity of
revealing my leadership credentials. Furthermore, I participated with the LAP Psyche club in plentiful informational sessions, where I studied once about Obsessive Compulsive Disorder OCD is a neurological disease that is associated with obsessions and stress… This extra-curricular activity highlighted everything related to the topic and explained, in brief, the causes and effects of such a disease. Also, I participated in an event with the Awaited Millennials/ MANAGEMENT SKILLS CENTER (Training, Motivating, Developing), a 7-day virtual event that targets introducing students to all available majors to help them better choose the major they want to study. As a student, this event gave me the capability to make sure that my intended futuristic major perfectly suits me.

 Many other interesting workshops and activities I was participating in during the past few years, including workshops related to Marine biology, genetically modified foods, self-confidence workshop, stress and anxiety workshop, mental health and well-being, and I worked closely with the British Council on a project related to polluting the River Tees that was based on creative writing and illustration.

Not only that, but social work is also the key to improving an individual’s character, due to the experiences one would gain from it. That's why I always aim to engage myself in as much social work as possible. For example, I volunteered with the “Palestinian Students Youth” in several activities, meetings, and events that would always take place in Saida, which helped me attain many social skills, meet new people, and be known in my society and community as an active individual. Moreover, I sometimes help in providing food and necessities for people in need, who live on Ain Al Helwe camp. Although it breaks my heart to see many of my people living in poor conditions, this social work helps me gain a sense of connection with them and gives me a sense of purpose. In addition, I am one of the participants in “Mariam For Social Development Center”, were we help vulnerable people, support them, and draw smiles on kids' faces. Also, ""Mariam"" is a center were women and girls are educated and encouraged to be active members of society. In this center, I encountered many new people, enhanced my public speaking skills when delivering presentations, and got more accommodated with the teamwork concept. I trust the saying “eyes never lie”, that's why I find it important to communicate with people face to face because I am a member of society and I can certainly understand others better this way, and be able to communicate with them. Therefore, I consider myself a very good communicator outside of school.

One of the main keys to reach success is making peace with yourself and accepting who you are to truly shine in any circumstance in your life. Once you do that and once you love yourself you'll be able to spread that peace and love around you. You'll be able to make a change in this world that's full of sins and hatred. I have learned that to make that change, you need to engage in your community and to be a productive person in your society.

 When I was a teenager, I was a member of the scouts for 4 years. I learned a lot of life and survival skills that helped me get through tough times, but more importantly we used to engage in volunteering activities by helping poor people, cleaning dirty roads, and serving food during Ramadan season. All of that gave me a sense of satisfaction, worthiness, and happiness. Those feelings lit a fire inside me that craves to help people and be kind to others.

  Furthermore, I love to attend workshops because I'm always eager to learn new stuff and skills. To elaborate on that, I attended Oterman's Institute Digital Impact Training (17-weeks) on employability and transferable skills in 2021. I also participated as a delegate in the 11th High School LAU Model Arab League Conference 2022 and I was a part of the Palestinian Affairs committee. This experience taught me a lot and hugely enhanced my public speaking skills. Moreover, I attended LAU webinars about presentation skills and journalism. I also participated in redcross workshops about humanitarian values & principles, enviromet, and youth & health. All of those topics opened my mind even further and taught me the importance of respecting one another and the importance of freedom.

  To sum up, all the experiences I went through made me the person who I am today. A person who respects humanitarian values and freedoms. A person who not only has leadership skills, but loves being a leader!

Through them, I've learned a myriad of newfound skills that are of great value in my daily life. To begin with, I was a part of the mental health club which sheds light on several social issues and tries to provide a healthy space for students, teachers and workers. One of the club’s main objectives was raising awareness on the importance of accepting diversity and limiting judgement. As a club member, I was a part of a group that held a session for younger classes in order to raise awareness on bullying. Bullying is a widespread issue that many are dealing with. People, nowadays, find it hard to accept others that have unique personalities and come from different social backgrounds, which often leads to bullying.
During our session, we wanted to portray the importance of making someone feel accepted and not judging based on a certain asset because everyone is different. Not only that, but the mental health club also did simple gestures such as giving away candy to young classes to cheer them up before classes and spread positivity. The mental health club has taught me the significance of having a healthy mental lifestyle and assisting others in developing such a lifestyle. 
Another workshop that I learned a lot from is The Leadership Program. Not only did the Leadership Training Program done by Haigazian University and Waznat help me gain important leadership and communication skills but it has also helped me evolve in different areas. It was a four week program that was made up of four sessions, each session shed light on a different topic from public speaking to problem solving. Throughout these sessions, I learned how important it is to be confident and what it actually means to be resilient. During the problem-solving session, they taught us about the steps that should be done when facing an obstacle and how to deal with things under pressure even if it means taking hard decisions
Currently, I am participating in a workshop funded by the U.S. Embassy about Excel and data analysis which would be of great value for me because I want to be a business major.

I've been in many events and activities that I've already mentioned some of the most important ones in the essay. However, I always like to take part in competitions, rivalries, workshops where I can prove my ability to be responsible, productive and innovative.
In grade 6, I participated in a maths competition organized by the Lebanese ministry of education on several stages. The first stage was at my school: between the students, I ranked first and could be qualified for the next stage at the level of North Governate. Finally, I took the last round nationally at the level of the whole country. Besides, I've participated in other events and ranked first ( as novels' competitions), and won in many workshops and competitions at LAU with my school as well as several events nationally and internationally. I can recall briefly:
_A national quiz of french dictation organized by the french institution
_Python workshop at University of Balamand 
_writing competitions ...
_Many other activities already mentioned (like EUROMED) in the previous essay (why you think you qualify)

Beside these activities, the team spirit distinguishes my participation while working with a group so that I can organize the work and tasks but without taking authority.
Furthermore, what does really makes my role special is my ability to represent the team as the team's spokesperson ( due to my ability to deliver a speech in an interesting and attractive style) as well as my formal writing style and ideas that fit eloquently and linguistically correct to be pronounced publicly. 
Otherwise, I'm not selfish and I do not encourage authoritarianism in sharing of roles, but rather I prefer to play all roles in a team in a normal way without superiority of one person over the other.
I can assure that I'm able to form new friends and adapt in all circumstances... There is no doubt that I have ambition, but I am content with my present and always strive to improve it in the future.

Finally, I don't believe in wasting time (and I don't mean rest here), but I do believe in the importance of always working towards a goal, no matter how simple it is. What draws my attention are the wise gatherings that call for awareness, development and the exchange of ideas away from what wastes my time without any benefit... I'm very receptive and extroverted, but I'd rather be introverted than being involved in an ignorant society.

As a volunteer in different organizations, I have learned that giving back to society is the most rewarding and fulfilling experience one can have. From my time at the Palestinian Red Cross to my work at the bake sale, I have discovered the power of human compassion and the importance of using one's talents and resources to make a positive impact in the world.
Participating in various events has taught me the value of diversity and the beauty of different cultures. Whether it was celebrating Ramadan with orphans or participating in MUN Lebanon, I have come to appreciate the richness of our world and the importance of mutual respect and understanding.
Through my work with the Blue Mission Organization and UNICEF, I have also learned the importance of combating misinformation and the role of education in promoting public health. I have developed a passion for science and medicine and hope to pursue a career in these fields.

Outside of volunteering, I am dedicated to personal growth and self-improvement. Reading books, learning new skills, and constantly challenging myself are all important aspects of my life. However, I never forget the importance of kindness and empathy in all aspects of life. Helping strangers in need, no matter how small the gesture, is a source of great joy and fulfillment for me.
Overall, my experiences have shaped my personality and taught me that my purpose in life is to help others and spread positivity and kindness wherever I go. I am grateful for the opportunities I have had and look forward to continuing my journey of personal and social growth.

 I became aware of how much recycling I was not doing and how much more I could be doing. One of the department’s goals is to make recycling accessible and convenient.
One of my tasks is to inspect recycling bins. Placing incorrect items in the recycling bin is called contamination. Take a moment to separate recyclables from trash because putting garbage or items that cannot be recycled in the recycling bins may result in the entire container being treated as garbage. When this happens the opportunity to recycle is wasted.
Recycling turns materials that would otherwise become waste into valuable resources. Some of the benefits of recycling include conserving natural resources, saving energy, preventing pollution and reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills. 
Incorporating a new item into recycling routine will have a positive effect. I pick up something I use a lot, like plastic sports drink bottles, and challenge myself to recycle them frequently.

The first volunteering opportunity I get was in our refugee camp with the solidarity association, and the project was focused on women's empowerment that aimed to give educational support to young girls who had low grades. After the first volunteering experience I gained more self-confidence and also my mental health was better I felt so good about volunteering and helping young girls, and I enjoyed every minute I spent there. I was lucky to impact young girls, that I had the chance to teach, in my own way of explaining to them. Since a lot of them wanted to leave school because of their low grades and they hated the school but after I talked to them and empower them they were influenced by me and the advice I gave to them, and we are friends now. I was not the only one who impacted them, however, they also impacted me.  This experience was life-changing for me since after that I wanted to volunteer to be part of my personality and started to do so every time I had the chance. I had the chance to volunteer with local organizations like ANERA during COVID, where I gave awareness campaigns to people in the camp and helped in cleaning and sterilizing schools and streets .l also had the chance to volunteer with UNICEF in an empowering program for high school students where I gained employment and digital literacy skills and get certifications after the workshop ended. I have also participated with the AL NAJDI association in organizing events, where I helped in making decorations and designing posts for the events. I have organized different events related to different occasions, some were for Women’s Day, some for land day, and some were for children. I can say that I love to leave a positive impact anywhere I go. All of the workshops and volunteering experiences I have been through have shaped me to be the person I am today and transformed me completely from being a shy girl to being an active girl full of life and believing more in herself and her abilities.
Being among the top students didn’t restrict me to spend all my days studying, in contrast, I like to cherish my efforts by going out to see people, communicating with them, and volunteering in any event or work that can benefit the community. So I try to balance my life in order to live the best of both worlds.

This saying underscores the significance of humans being part of social groups. Someone who is completely isolated from others might go insane. This is why communities are crucial in this world. They help people socialize and interact. For this reason, it is one’s duty to be active in their community and help it prosper. Personally, I have participated in multiple workshops and spent some time volunteering to help my community grow.
For starters, I partook in some workshops hosted by Life Sculptor about mental health. One of the workshops was about dementia, and it took a deep dive into the causes, types, and ways to deal with patients of this disease. This helped me understand the situation of an elderly relative who is showing signs of this disease. Another workshop that was about mental well-being was about bipolar disorder and its grave consequences on its victims. Also, I participated in a workshop about personality traits that allowed me to understand myself much more than before. 
Moreover, I attended a workshop organized by Life Sculptor about genetic engineering and the promising new advancements in this field. Namely, it discussed the CRISPR-Cas9 that can edit DNA sequence. This nurtured my knowledge and kept me up to date on the astounding developments in genetics. In addition to that, I was part of a workshop about physiotherapy hosted by Fly and Glow. It specifically discussed sports injuries. Discopathy was also talked about and how it can be prevented through exercise.
After witnessing the impact Life Sculptor had, I decided to join it as a volunteer. Being part of its research team gave me a sense of responsibility for the validity of the information that is being collected for the presentations for their workshops. Hence, I worked with great precision and browsed multiple sources before handing in my assignments. Becoming part of this team allowed me to give back to a community in dire need of help from its people.
In conclusion, this is how I filled my time outside of my schoolwork. Unfortunately, it is not what I can fully achieve but my residence dictates it.

          Even though I’ve been the ""nerd"" and ""topper"" in my class for pretty much all of my life, after I woke up to reality, I realized that that alone is not in any way enough to succeed and be a functioning member of society. Being smart and actually possessing fine mental abilities, as appealing as it may seem, is only a part of being. The other part comes from working hard and experiencing new stuff through engaging with the community, participating in competitions, attending workshops…

          Starting with what I’m most proud of: the ""Daffi Jarak"" initiative, where back in November, a group of friends and I initiated a philanthropic movement where we collected winter clothes (jackets, sweatshirts, pants, shoes...) from people who don’t need them and gave them to poor people in the Beddawi camp; we ended up helping about 200 individuals cover and warm up for the winter. What I like about it is that not only have I helped some people in need, but I’ve also developed my responsibility and teamwork skills throughout the initiative. I also participated in cultural and social activities like the Iftar project for poor fasting people, done at the Arabic Palestinian Cultural Club center in last year's and this year’s Ramadan, and improved my school’s environment. Another thing I’m doing right now is guiding 11th graders in my school by helping them find their careers, making them stronger candidates, and giving them tips for the SAT.

          Last year, in a team of 5, we participated in a global competition called ""The Earth Prize"", where we helped drive positive change toward environmental sustainability. Even though we didn’t win, I’ve learned a valuable lesson in teamwork and how to direct a team, not to mention the amount of knowledge and experience I gained where I was working on the design of a machine and a project that I might think more about executing in the future.

          As I mentioned in my previous essay, I love learning new stuff and expanding my knowledge and area of expertise. For that, I’ve attended and completed a dozen workshops, including web development, Microsoft Word, Google Workspace... that were offered by BRAVE UNICEF (100 hours combined). I’ve also attended 10 online workshops given by the Lebanese American University about a variety of topics—teamwork, public speaking, communication, creativity, etc.—and I’m now attending diverse online workshops that are being given by ""Life Sculptor."" Finally, I’ve completed some online courses about artificial intelligence, machine learning, ethical hacking…

          Ending with some other things that I’ve done before the quarantine, like winning a competition called ""Al Motafawekoon,"" where the smartest 3 students of each UNRWA school are set to compete based on their general knowledge and knowledge about our mother country, Palestine. Also, I’ve competed in and won a couple of chess tournaments, winning a cup and medals.

Khalil Gibran managed to perfect the definition of giving when he said, ""You give but little when you give of your possessions."" ""It is when you give of yourself that you truly give."" There is no truer, more concise definition of the true meaning. Giving is not about giving money; it is about giving your time in order to put a smile on someone’s face. Being a social and active person, and being someone who totally believes in what Gibran said. Throughout the years, I did my best to put his words into action. I participated in all helping programs held by my school, such as collecting donations and sending them to poor people, especially before every holiday, to ensure that they get a chance to celebrate like other people. I made sure I was there to see their smiles, and knowing that giving isn't about money, I and my friends spent as much time as we could with those people, listening to their stories and alleviating their pain wherever we could. This allowed us to be a part of their lives while also enriching ours. I also did community service hours where I helped clean up public areas and plant trees that were about to go extinct. This allowed me to gain more friends and learn from my experiences as well.

From joining scout teams to helping in growing plants and assisting the elderly, these experiences have helped shape who I am today.

Whether it's lending a hand to the elderly or spending my weekends cleaning up local parks, I feel a sense of fulfillment in knowing that I've made a positive impact on the world around me. This is a trait that has been instilled in me since a young age, and one that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.

Another thing that sets me apart from others is my adaptability. As someone who has changed schools three times, I've learned to adapt to new environments quickly. This experience has given me a unique perspective on how to help others who may be going through similar changes. Whether it's making new friends or navigating a new school system, I feel equipped to help others through challenging transitions.

In addition to being adaptable, I am also committed to the environment. By helping in growing plants and cleaning up public spaces, I am doing my part to create a better world for all. This is a value that I hold dear, and one that I hope to inspire others to embrace as well.

Finally, my experiences helping the elderly have taught me the importance of empathy towards others. Whether it's helping someone cross the street or simply listening to their stories, I believe that everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect. Through my work with the elderly, I have gained a deeper appreciation for the value of human connection.

For me, what makes me special outside of school work is my passion for volunteering, my ability to be a good listener, and my talent for creating and completing projects.

Volunteering has always been an important part of my life. I grew up watching my parents volunteer their time and resources to various causes and organizations, and it inspired me to do the same. Over the years, I have volunteered with a number of different organizations, including animal shelters, food banks, and community outreach programs. What I love most about volunteering is the sense of fulfillment and purpose it gives me. When I'm volunteering, I feel like I'm making a real difference in the lives of others. Whether I'm helping to feed the hungry, care for animals, or mentor young people, I know that I'm contributing to something greater than myself.


In addition to volunteering, I have found that I am a good listener. I believe that listening to others and really hearing what they have to say is an essential part of building strong relationships and understanding different perspectives. Whether it's a friend, family member, or colleague, I take the time to listen attentively and respond thoughtfully. I believe this skill has helped me become a more empathetic and compassionate person, which in turn has made me a better volunteer.
Finally, I also have a talent for creating and completing projects. Whether it's planning a fundraiser for a non-profit organization or organizing a community event, I enjoy the process of coming up with ideas and seeing them through to fruition. I believe that my ability to plan and execute projects has helped me in my volunteer work and will also serve me well in my future career.

Overall, my passion for volunteering, my ability to be a good listener, and my talent for creating and completing projects are what make me special outside of school work. They are a part of who I am and what I stand for, and I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had to make a positive impact in the world.

Yes,Female,2023-2024,Yes,No,Yes,No,Private,Yes,Life Sciences - LS,89,0.91,0.84,Yes,2 times," For the first time, I experienced the power of selflessness and the true joy that comes from helping others. The feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction that came from giving back to my community was truly immeasurable and lifted the weight that had been burdening my heart. It made me realize the significance of being a part of something greater than myself and the importance of spreading kindness and positivity to those around me.
 I eagerly embraced the opportunity to join a community service club and participated in our first project, a visit to an orphanage. The experience only reinforced my love for helping others, seeing the joy on the children's faces as we provided them with essentials like food, drinks, and warm clothing for the cold weather. That day was automatically ranked into my favorites, reinvigorating my determination to continue volunteering and making a difference in others' lives. 
 The second volunteering opportunity that I was lucky enough to be a part of was a cooking club. This experience was truly special and close to my heart, as it allowed me to not only showcase my cooking skills but also bring happiness to those who needed it the most. We, as a team, put in all our effort and love into preparing meals for the underprivileged people in our community. Every ingredient that went into the cooking was picked with care, and every dish was made with excitement and anticipation of the joy it would bring to the people we were serving. It was a humbling and rewarding experience, and I feel grateful to have been a part of it.
 I believe that as a member of the community, it is my duty to give back and make a difference in others' lives, no matter how small the act may be. My most recent act of service involved providing encouragement and support to sixth-grade students as they navigated through their midyear exams. I sought to alleviate their worries by reminding them to leave their concerns behind and by offering practical tips and advice on how to cultivate confidence in their abilities. I am proud to have successfully accomplished my goal and helped these young students approach their exams with a newfound sense of belief in themselves.
Additionally, I joined the Model United Nations (MUN) and found a new passion for being a staff member. After observing the role of staff for two years, I decided to take part in my school's MUN (Harmun) as a staff member and trainer. My goal was to guide younger participants and help them understand the flow of the competition, so they could make the most out of this life-changing opportunity.
 I eagerly look forward to future volunteer opportunities and am committed to making a difference in the lives of those around me. These experiences, combined with the many upcoming volunteer initiatives planned by the community service club, have helped me to grow as a person and solidify my commitment to giving back to my community.

Starting off by increasing my familiarity with my own field of interest by participating in AUB’s SREP program in which I was able to truly learn and dive deeper into the fields of astrophysics that enamored me, collaborating with my classmate in order to spread the joy of astronomy through our winning entry “Flare like No Other” to the BAU national science of 2022, leading my team to be accepted into the GLEE Luna-Sat program where we built our own Luna-Sat, and; lastly, being recently accepted into Tech-girls which is a US STEM summer exchange program for girls coming from disadvantaged countries! All these science-related endeavors helped me develop my love and understanding of physics and engineering, furthering my drive to succeed in my dream, and further refuting my doubts regarding subverting others’ expectations. 

    A scientist who does not communicate his/her ideas is no more than a lost chance of change. This is why I worked on acquiring leadership, versatility, and communication skills through participating and leading my team to win Shabab Lab’s “AR for Social Impact” through our passion project “Basmat Zaman”, conducting a research project on the effects of Covid-19 on youth in collaboration with the University of Huddersfield in London, winning first place in the “Value-and-Values” essay competition where I had to express my thoughts on the economic value of time, being enrolled for two consecutive years in my school’s volleyball team, as well as winning “Secretary General” in LAUMGG 2022. All these experiences and opportunities served to make me a better communicator both verbally and in writing, an asset essential for every creative mechanical engineer and brilliant physicist.

     Of course, working as an engineer or a physicist is a noble career path, working to provide the community with knowledge and resources. This is why working on my community service was essential in the list of steps my dream takes in the path to achieve. I started off with volunteering at my school volunteering association, garnering up to 60 hours of volunteering service in different events and campaigns including donation gathering and sorting for the less-privileged.. However, I have realized that this alone will not guarantee the lessons I need to be the best physicist I am able to be. This is why I nominated myself and won the grade 12 student council elections at my school, dedicating my time to ensure the needs of my schoolmates are met. Additionally, I chose to share some of the knowledge I garnered during LAUMGG by becoming an advisor for 32 hardworking delegates, aiding them in debate and communication skills that I had to learn on my own!

Not only have I been able to gain valuable skills and knowledge in the field of emergency medicine, but I have also been given the opportunity to make a positive impact in my community.

 First and foremost, being a first aid volunteer has taught me the importance of being able to think quickly and calmly under pressure. In emergency situations, every second counts and being able to assess the situation and take appropriate action can mean the difference between life and death. Through my training and on-the-job experience, I have learned to remain composed and focused even in the most chaotic of circumstances.

 Additionally, volunteering as a first aid responder has given me the chance to give back to my community. I have been able to help individuals in need and make a real difference in their lives. Whether it's providing first aid at a local event, or responding to an emergency call, I know that my actions have the potential to positively impact someone's life.

 Furthermore, being a volunteer in first aid has also helped me to develop a sense of empathy and compassion. Seeing people in vulnerable states and providing them with care and support has taught me the importance of being kind, patient and understanding.

 Lastly, my volunteer work in first aid has made my work outside of school feel especially meaningful. I have been able to apply the skills and knowledge I have gained through my volunteer work to other areas of my life. Furthermore, it has taught me the importance of giving back to the community and has made me want to continue to volunteer and make a positive impact in the world.

 Overall, volunteering as a first aid responder has been a truly enriching experience for me.

In a matter of two years, I went from a shy person who overthought every word she wanted to speak to someone who can speak up without any issues. It was all thanks to the volunteering and workshops I did.
  I volunteered for one year at Al Mobader organization, a center that specialized in helping struggling kids, and I learned a lot while I did that. Working with so many children from a set of different backgrounds and conditions has opened my eyes to the reality of the world. I met kids with anger issues, kids with the purest hearts, and kids who have been hardened by the things they faced at such a young age. It may seem overwhelming and I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t that at first. Being a shy person, it was hard to communicate with them but I knew I had to do something to live up to the responsibility I was entrusted with. Little by little, I got out of my comfort zone and started speaking up. The height of discomfort for me was at the anti-drug campaign I participated in, with that same organization, where I had to survey the parents of those kids and talk to them. At times, it made me want to crawl out of my skin but I stayed strong because it was for the better. Ultimately this experience honed my leadership skills and made me a better public speaker.
  A once-in-a-lifetime experience for me was when I was selected, along with 3 others, to represent our school in the sustainability competition “ Earth Prize”. It was one of the highlights of last year. There were uncomfortable situation-ships of disagreement where stepping up was a no-brainer and I did just that. I pitched an idea of plastic-eating mushrooms and it got us chosen as the only team representing Lebanon. Pride would be an understatement because when I received that email it was like someone put me on the moon itself.
   Along with those, I did multiple workshops about computer literacy, app building, robotics, and life skills. The computer-literacy activities were to expand my knowledge while the other tech-related gigs were what sparked my interest in computer science as a potential career. Yet the real star of the show was the life skills sessions. During those sessions, I was forced into lots of uncomfortable situations where speaking u was a must. There I learned how to communicate better, respect other opinions even if I didn’t necessarily agree with them, and work around my fear of public speaking.
  
   I can say with true honesty that these past couple of years made me who I am today. There’s no way I’d have accomplished any of the personal growth I’ve had without them. Any, if not all, of the development I did, is credited to the people I worked with and the situations I was in.",0,"American University of Beirut (AUB), Lebanese American University (LAU)",No,Widowed,No,No,No,No,No,0,Yes,Done,Done,1080,Eligible,Considered,Income Higher,0,TRUE,1,Avg,discovering world extracurricular activity one best move ever made matter two year went shy person overthought every word wanted speak someone speak without issue thanks volunteering workshop volunteered one year al mobader organization center specialized helping struggling kid learned lot working many child set different background condition opened eye reality world met kid anger issue kid purest heart kid hardened thing faced young age may seem overwhelming ’ lying said ’ first shy person hard communicate knew something live responsibility entrusted little little got comfort zone started speaking height discomfort antidrug campaign participated organization survey parent kid talk time made want crawl skin stayed strong better ultimately experience honed leadership skill made better public speaker onceinalifetime experience selected along 3 others represent school sustainability competition “ earth prize ” one highlight last year uncomfortable situationships disagreement stepping nobrainer pitched idea plasticeating mushroom got u chosen team representing lebanon pride would understatement received email like someone put moon along multiple workshop computer literacy app building robotics life skill computerliteracy activity expand knowledge techrelated gig sparked interest computer science potential career yet real star show life skill session session forced lot uncomfortable situation speaking u must learned communicate better respect opinion even ’ necessarily agree work around fear public speaking say true honesty past couple year made today ’ way ’ accomplished personal growth ’ without development credited people worked situation,0.160494305,Nothing,2,6,0,5,4,0,0,3,1

To begin with, in summer 2021 I volunteered at “ The Popular Aid For Relief and Development” non-profit organization, where we distributed foodstuffs, clothes and cleaners to refugees and poor people. It was a wonderful experience that left me with an indescribably beautiful feeling of helping others and especially people who are in need. 

 Moreover, in the year 2022 I spent a fabulous summer when I volunteered at “Colonie Sayfona Tasaly'' as a main coach who takes care of kids and is responsible for their food, hygiene, comfort and happiness. We did different activities and went on many trips and experienced many new things together, so I built a strong relationship with all the kinds at the colonie and I still communicate with them till now. This was an amazing experience, in which I enjoyed every single moment I spent with the kids, and at the same time I benefited a lot from it where it boosted my self-confidence and strengthened my personality. Also, I remember when I completed all my tasks perfectly, the supervisor at the colonie announced me to be “coach of the week” and I was certified for that. So, I am planning to volunteer also in summer 2023 at the colonie to repeat that amazing experience.

In addition to that, when I was in grade 10 I participated in the “BAU Virtual Science Fair” where my topic was about “Corona Virus”, I chose this theme because I felt that it is very essential to shed light on such an important topic, and to raise awareness on such a pandemic disease. So, I discussed its causes, symptoms, effects and the methods to prevent ourselves from it. I also provided pictures, videos, animations and a model for this virus, where I worked on it by myself to make my project clearer and more realistic. Then, I felt very proud when I was presenting this project, which I put much effort and worked on for weeks.

Furthermore, in my school “National Evangelical Institute for Girls and Boys-Saida”, we as the L.S students in grade 12 are planning a big volunteer project. In which, we are working on cleaning and improving the graves of our former school principals, who are “William Eddy” and “George Ford” and remembering people of their achievements and how they helped our country in the past, knowing that William Eddy was nominated for the presidency of the United States.

Yes,Female,2022-2023,No,No,No,No,Private,Yes,General Sciences - GS,88.275,82.2,85.33,Yes,2 times,"     I am a proud member of my village’s Scouts Group. With them, I have been able to organize multiple events such as environmental, social, and fundraising events. Currently, I am a member of my Class’ Prom Committee and the Treasurer. All the money from the events comes back to me. To stay on top of everything, I have devised 2 mechanisms: one is a paper-based spreadsheet and another is computer-based through Microsoft Excel. Also, I plan and execute fundraising events. For example,  throughout the year, we had multiple football matches, a kids’ carnival, a raffle, etc. For the football matches, I always stayed at the stand quickly taking money from people and stamping their hands (to prove that they paid). As for the carnival, I was basically in charge of everything. I made sure everyone stayed in position and solved any problem that arose on hand. Finally, for the Raffle, I was in charge of finding places to give out coupons as prizes, calling them, negotiating a price, and designing the “look” of the ticket and a matching advertisement. Last but not least, among my other responsibilities, is finding a venue to do our prom. This was probably one of my most challenging tasks (as we can’t really have enough money due to the current situation), but I did manage to find a decent venue well within our budget.  
     In grade 10, my class and I started working to raise money for an orphanage. We had a few bake sales in school. In preparation, I baked a few goods and got a few small toys to sell to the kids as part of a raffle. During the sale, I managed the financial aspect of the fundraiser, basically counting the money, organizing the books, and calculating our revenue and profit. Then, we were going to go and teach the kids how to read, organize a fair, and throw a small party. However, for the sake of the children, we refrained from going after the Coronavirus struck. 
     In other words, I am extremely responsible. I do not focus solely on academic achievement, but I also enjoy helping others and being in charge. I can work under pressure, and I love planning activities and events!",1,American University of Beirut (AUB),No,Married,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,0,No,No,No,1082,Eligible,Not Considered,Expenses Higher,0,TRUE,1,High,proud member village ’ scout group able organize multiple event environmental social fundraising event currently member class ’ prom committee treasurer money event come back stay top everything devised 2 mechanism one paperbased spreadsheet another computerbased microsoft excel also plan execute fundraising event example throughout year multiple football match kid ’ carnival raffle etc football match always stayed stand quickly taking money people stamping hand prove paid carnival basically charge everything made sure everyone stayed position solved problem arose hand finally raffle charge finding place give coupon prize calling negotiating price designing “ look ” ticket matching advertisement last least among responsibility finding venue prom probably one challenging task ’ really enough money due current situation manage find decent venue well within budget grade 10 class started working raise money orphanage bake sale school preparation baked good got small toy sell kid part raffle sale managed financial aspect fundraiser basically counting money organizing book calculating revenue profit going go teach kid read organize fair throw small party however sake child refrained going coronavirus struck word extremely responsible focus solely academic achievement also enjoy helping others charge work pressure love planning activity event,0.130169659,Real Estate,0,2,0,0,2,0,1,0,0

As a Palestinian refugee, I have had a beautiful experience there.

       Workshops are a very fascinating activity. I don't have time to attend many courses, but at least I gave two a shot: CPR and first aid classes. I attended a course where I gained knowledge on how to care for patients and heal their wounds until they can go to the hospital, as well as how to perform CPR on a person whose heart has stopped in order to save his life.

  “It is crucial to maintain optimism in the face of all obstacles and to be able to predict the conclusion since failure to plan leads to failure to succeed.” This statement motivates me to work more for society as a whole as well as for myself. After the significant explosion on August 4th, I can still clearly recall visiting some homes close to the Beirut Port with a group of volunteers. I was inspired to lend additional assistance, no matter how little, by the smiles that were painted on the faces of the injured. Our main objective was to take part in Beirut's ascent.
   I won't talk about who I am or what makes me unique, but I do enjoy discussing how I managed to maintain my optimism in the face of adversity. I was able to excel in each of these areas by juggling my education and voluntary work in different areas especially in the areas related to the environment. Helping the environment is one of the goals I always work to. I remained resilient and made an effort to succeed in the Lebanese community in the face of all the criticism I received. 
   In short, we shall all achieve our goals and contribute to the world by forming relationships with people from other social classes. To rise through the social ranks and become tomorrow's leaders, we should all work together. Eventually, I would hopefully like to encourage others to persistently pursue fields of study and activities to eventually empower themselves, their families, and hopefully, once they become professionals in their fields, society as a whole.

Streets were crowded, schools were shut down, workplaces were closed. For once almost all Lebanese citizens were united, to hold the corrupted politicians accountable.
Accountability is an indispensable value in life, and people who are in the wrong must be held accountable. Despite the politicians’ threats of punishing the revolutionists, my friend and I decided to gather and take lead of a group of my classmates and revolt around the streets of Beirut, demanding change and accountability for the political staff.
We formed a group of 50 students and roamed around the government’s facilities demanding immediate change. The economic and political state of the country had become unbearable, and citizens were struggling to get access of our basic needs.
We spent hours revolting, holding out signs asking for change and pouring our hearts out. However, one must always remember, demanding for your rights does not mean violating others’. Thus, after we finished our mission, we spent the rest of the night cleaning up where we littered.
2 years later, change is starting to take place. Although things are still difficult on us but we held the people behind the corruption accountable. Throughout the revolution, myself and many others in the same generation discovered the power of leadership and accountability and how essential they are to the society.
No one knows what the future holds, however change is imminent if people step up and demand what is theirs.
No matter how hard things in lebanon are or may be in the future, I believe that I, as well as hundreds of inspiring young people, am able to make a huge difference to help my beloved country capable of holding me close and keeping me connected with my family and land.

As a member of the Islamic Scout Team, our primary objective is to provide assistance to those in need, offer children the opportunity to engage in enriching activities and learn new skills, and provide entertainment and support to families living in Lebanon through practical monthly programs. For example, scouts often embark on excursions that allow them to explore the great outdoors and cultivate leadership abilities and sportsmanship. It is our aim to bring joy to the faces of parents as they witness their children showcasing the newfound skills they have acquired through scripted performances. In addition, our team engages in charitable work, such as distributing food and clothing to disadvantaged families on specific occasions, such as Ramadan and Eid.
I have also had the privilege of volunteering at the ActiveAgingHouse, where we made concerted efforts to provide a comfortable and welcoming environment for the elderly.

At the Active House, we go above and beyond simply providing meals; we strive to create a familial atmosphere and bring the elderly together through activities such as games and drawing sessions that nurture their minds and promote teamwork.

Yes,Male,2023-2024,Yes,No,No,No,Private,Yes,General Sciences - GS,92.935,88.5,87.49,Yes,2 times," Ever since I was a child I found passion in extra-curricular activities, school wok just wasn’t enough for me, so that’s when I decided I want to join different clubs and voluntary work to make my time more efficient and to open opportunities for myself so I can learn new skills and obtain various information, all while aiming to give back to my community.

  The first club I joined was a robotics club in middle school. It was a new experience and this experience provided me with enlightening information about the robotic technology and how it works. It was truly fascinating and the more I learned about it the more invested I got. In addition to the information I got, I was lucky to work with a small team of ambitious students like me that found interest in this project. Therefore, this experience taught me about the essential skills needed for cooperation and group success.
 
  Other clubs that I joined were the Model Arab League and the Model United Nations clubs. Entering these clubs was supported by my school advisors whom chose me as one of the few selected candidates to join and participate in this project as representatives to our school’s name. These models of global organizations rise upon enhancing an individual’s democratic skills and the art of speech and communication. I went through various diplomatic debates during the competitions I participated in and with each experience I managed to develop some necessary skill that should be used on a daily and professional basis. 

 I was just in first grade when I discovered my love for mathematics. I found myself to be good at it and just solving different mathematical problems gave me joy. This lead to me joining my favorite club yet which was called SMART which is short for “Soroban Mental Arithmetic Rapid Techniques”. The term speaks for itself. It is a club that teaches methods to solve math equations using fast and rapid techniques. It’s all about practice and the more you practice the better you become at it.  Similar to the Model Nations club this one wasn’t a club that anyone can join, one has to be specifically selected by the school in order to be part of this club, and I was honored to be one of them. I was driven towards this club with passion because of my love for math and this pushed me to excel and become more than just a regular member of this club. Thanks to this passion and  discipline I became one of only 2 students from my school to travel to Thailand in 2017 to participate in the international SMART competition held by Gajma, and went back home with a first place prize that honored me and my country.

  Additionally, I also worked at some charity jobs. One of these charities was cooking and preparing different meals in order to serve them for those in need. We were in charge of packaging and delivery. It was a non-profitable job; the only payment we got was seeing the pure joy and happiness on people’s face. It was fun working with people that had the same ambition to give back to the community and trying to change people’s harsh reality into one with hope. This experience taught me valuable life lessons and it showed me the importance of being grateful for what I have.

One of the most significant clubs I joined was the debate club, which focused on argumentation, research, and critical thinking. Being part of this group allowed me to understand how to formulate my ideas, present convincing arguments, and defend my point of view. I learned that it is crucial to listen to opposing perspectives, consider different viewpoints, and make informed decisions. These skills have helped me in several aspects of my life, such as understanding political issues and collaborating with others to find solutions to problems.

Apart from the debate club, I also participated in volunteering projects and community outreach programs. I joined a local organization that offered free education and mentorship to children from low-income families. Being part of this organization gave me the opportunity to connect with these children and understand their challenges. It also helped me develop communication, empathy, and leadership skills. I learned that it is crucial to be patient, encouraging, and supportive when dealing with people from different backgrounds.

In terms of extracurricular activities, I have always enjoyed playing sports. I joined a basketball team outside school, which gave me the chance to develop my physical fitness, teamwork, and sportsmanship. Playing sports has taught me to be disciplined, focused, and committed to my goals. It has also given me the opportunity to develop my competitive spirit and learn how to cope with failure and setbacks.

Overall, what makes me special outside of school is my passion for learning, exploring new opportunities, and engaging with diverse groups of people. I am always eager to discover different cultures, perspectives, and experiences.

Yes,Male,2023-2024,Yes,No,No,No,Private,Yes,Life Sciences - LS,91,88.25,85.99,Yes,2 times,"One of my first volunteering jobs involved helping people in need by working at a charity kitchen. That volunteering job lasted a span of three consecutive summers. We visited the kitchen at 3 o’clock in the afternoon, packaging up freshly cooked meals of rice, protein portions of either meat or chicken, and some sort of soup or salad to accompany that meal. Thankfully we were able to prepare and pack almost 500 meals per day, we then proceeded to distribute those 500 meals across 300 different homes. To see the faces of grateful parents, and to see the joy brought upon the faces of children, whom are finally being offered a meal after suffering an empty stomach for a lot longer than any man should suffer let alone a child, is much more rewarding than any paycheck could ever be. 
Ever since then, the idea of giving rather than taking formed my new mentality. That made me go on to participate in my next volunteering job which involved, yet again, seeing the faces of little children light up as they were given what they rightfully deserve. I worked as a teacher for a group of little kids throughout the summer before 11th grade; Me and my one of my friends were responsible of a class of 20 children for 3 hours each day. Day by day we were able to get the hang of that teaching job and were able to provide the kids with fun ways to learn while making sure they understand the lesson fully. 
As for clubs, I have participated in three different clubs, each throughout a separate scholastic year. I participated in the GCLAUMUN program; each student was a delegate for a certain country that is a member of the United Nations, we were given a topic concerning the countries conflicts with each other, conflicts within a certain country, a humanitarian issue that must be brought to light, or the well-being of our planet. Each delegate carries on to research the presented topic and give speeches on behalf of the country he or she is representing. By the end of the two day conference, all the delegates must reach a resolution that benefits all and resolves the problem at hand.
I also participated in the robotics club, where we participated as team in the Arduino and the FLL competitions. Both competitions were similar; we were given robot parts and a task, we write the code and build a robot able to carry out that task, then we set the robot on the track and let it fulfil its duty. Those two competitions really helped me and my peers get the hang of a very important skill, which is problem solving.

I also participated in the annual celebration of the center and supervised the most important tasks, many of which include: arranging books, supervising their coordination and arrangement in the celebration, directing the audience and giving them guidance in the celebration and providing them with the necessary information. I also participated in the monthly magazine that the center holds and summarized many scientific books.  All this helped me to strengthen my personality and increased my interaction with the community and also contributed to the acquisition of many skills such as leadership, handling difficult matters, coordination, patience and dealing with children, and it also made me gain many friends..
 
 At school I volunteered in a lot of clubs and activities.  One of the most important of them was helping my classmates with difficult lessons.

Also, in the Palestinian Civil Defense, I attended many training courses with them, went on camping trips, and learned how to live with primitive materials, and how to start a fire and cut wood.  Of course, all of this was within a team, and this is what stimulated the team spirit in me at all times.

However, as the country plunged into an economic crisis along with social unrest, a large fragment of its people was left deprived of basic human needs. Seeing such difficult conditions tempted me to give back to my community. After contacting “Nusaned”, a local NGO, I encouraged my friends to participate in a volunteering mission. At first, we were responsible for their storage unit, and I headed the process of receiving, packing, and distributing sanitary products while the team assessed their quality and quantity. However, a greater desire for engaging in service grew inside me with every accomplishment. So, my team took an additional role, where through direct communication we assessed the type and amount of support each family needed. After a year of participation, I became experienced in such delicate conversations where difficult situations were assessed, and the coordination of my team tailored the support for each family to their basic needs. At school, I participated in social entrepreneurship workshop at “Injaz” and gained valuable skills allowing me to emerge as a socially responsible member of the community. Proposing a community service project guided by entrepreneurial qualities allowed me to expand my range of thought and creativity and utilize them for the greater good. I also formed the chemistry and medicine clubs along with a friend to share knowledge across the school and explore my areas of interest with others. Outside school, I expanded my academic interests by taking shadowing opportunities at AUBMC and CMC where I got a clear insight into the lives of physicians. I attended rounds in ICU, oncology, and bone marrow transplant floors, visiting and observing the assessment of patients. I also had a great opportunity to attend lectures conducted for medical students for my experience to be holistic and cover all the aspects of my anticipated career. My vision of leaving an impact would be through expanding the scale of projects I pursue as I become more specialized and experienced. As an aspiring physician, my evolving expertise would become an effective tool in contributing to the cycle of supporting nations and humanity toward a healthier community.

Outside the schools, my activity was reached the maximum during Covid-19 pandemic where we used to stay at home and most of the activities were done online. I shared once in a program under the title “Scientific Research” done by To Read club, a club in the American university of Beirut AUB. It includes many activities, such as preparing homemade experiments, collaborating with students from different places in Lebanon in the form of groups and etc. I learned through such experience how to make a scientific research paper that is an objective acquired by students in the university. Also, as groups, we were able to present our research about any scientific idea in an expert way in the form of a PowerPoint presentation. In addition to that, we were supposed to listen to some lectures held by people who have reached success, and we had the intention to ask questions in order to have more knowledge. Another experience I can add to the history of my life, though I didn’t complete due to having exams and other projects at school but I have acquired all the shared knowledge, is sharing in a program held by Phoenicia University PU under the title PMUN. It gave us information about the steps and the techniques used to write a position paper, and I was able also to know the different steps of a meeting that could be held by any part of the United Nations UN.

      For the most of its history, my elementary school has deeply been influenced by clubs, as most of the extracurricular events and activities at school were organized every year.  As a student who had lots of passion to sciences and solving problems, I felt a strong sense of duty to join the smart club at school for two consecutive years, a club tasked with providing an extraordinary haven for individuals who wish to empower their thinking abilities and boost their mental solving skills. 
     Meanwhile I was also a participant in many other events like the MAL that taught me lots of communication and interaction skills where I got engaged with students all over the country and shared with them my experience, plus it enhanced my ways of thinking and boosted my courage to speak out and defend what I see right whatever it costs. 
      Going to the middle school, I was one of the members of the robotics club through which I learned several techniques for designing machines and robots by giving them certain orders to do. In addition, I was at the same year a participant in the international Arabic reading competition that enriched my knowledge and dictionary and lightened my path to start my reading journey that is ongoing till today. 
      However, the turning point of my tendencies was when I shared in training sessions about the first aid procedures where I experienced how to deal with strokes, attacks, fainting and breathing problems. Add to that, I also got immersed in a very unique workshop given by an internist which I’ve attended for three weeks. It was all about dealing with the internal body systems focusing mostly on the circulatory system, where I got to know the importance of it and the causes of many severe cases like the blood pressure, the oxygen rate and heart strokes. I also took an idea about the tools used to measure the normal pressure, heart rate, and blood sugar.
      At the end, I’m still hoping for many upcoming volunteering activities to share with and engage in because participating in such activities has impacted me on many levels, skill wise and social wise. I gained a fresh perspective in the field of communication and I was capable of making many relations and connections. On the other hand, I was also enhancing my character on different prospects.

Later on, I worked for the team developing the project via online meetings and planning, building an application to boost the people’s engagement in events through a garden inside the school.

         One of the projects that I participated in is rise challenge, and this project revolves around choosing a global problem and making video on how to solve it. I choosed two problems, the first one was the lack of education because there are many children who do not go to school due of poverty and this thing is very dangerous as it not only spread ignorance but also poverty. Since when the parents are poor they do not send their children to learn, therefore when the children grow up, they will be poor and will nao send their children to school. Thus, the poverty and ignorance will spread in society. And my plan to help was by building free schools in the poorest places of the world so that the children could learn. I want to be an engineer, so I can volunteer with an association that aims around learning, so I can volunteer in building schools and they can provide teachers to teach. By that, we are not just have provide a good future for them, but we have also taught them to help so they will help needy people when they grow up and by that the peace will spread among the world. The other problem I choosed to work on is the lack of health care, the health is wealth and it is important to do any work in this world, the main reason that lead me to choose this problem is the Corona pandemic. During this situation, I started to read the focused news where the people suffered from this disease and they died due to the lack of health care. My plan was in being doctor to work with association in voluntary hospital inorder to help the people. But now I want to be an engineer and l can help in this field by building hospitals.

We helped by made our surroundings aware of the importance of the vaccine to get rid of the disease, in the end we noticed that we were actually able to convince some of people whose were initially dismissive.

I ended up getting the sixth place on the whole country. Later, I participated in a marathon in my city in which i ranked 3rd in the girls league. A couple of years later, I registered in a reading competition in which I was assigned to read 50 books of different topics within 2 months and talk about them in an interview.

It enables individuals to give back to their communities, learn new skills, and develop a sense of responsibility and commitment towards making the world a better place. As an individual, I have been involved in various community service activities, including being the president of the student council of my institution and participating in international debate competitions.

One of my most notable community service activities was serving as the president of the student council of my institution. As the president, I had the opportunity to work with students from different backgrounds and cultures to implement various projects and initiatives that would benefit the entire student body. This role helped me develop several critical skills, including leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving. I was responsible for leading meetings, managing finances, and overseeing the execution of various projects. Through this experience, I learned how to communicate effectively, delegate tasks, and motivate others to work towards a common goal. These skills have been instrumental in my personal and professional growth, and I continue to apply them in my everyday life.

Another significant community service activity I participated in was debating. I have been passionate about debating for several years, and I have participated in numerous competitions both locally and internationally. Through the debate club at AUB, I was able to receive training and mentorship from experienced debaters, which helped me refine my skills and develop new ones. Debating has helped me become a better communicator, critical thinker, and researcher. It has also helped me develop a deeper understanding of global issues and how to articulate my ideas and thoughts effectively.

Aside from these activities, I have also been involved in other community service projects. I have volunteered in several organizations, including a local orphanage, where I spent time with the children, organized games and activities, and provided support and care. I have also volunteered in clean-up campaigns in my local community, where I helped to clean the streets and public spaces. These experiences have taught me the value of giving back and the importance of community service.

In conclusion, community service has been a significant part of my personal and professional growth. Being the president of the student council of my institution and participating in international debate competitions have helped me develop critical skills that I have been able to apply in various aspects of my life.

    Volunteering can be a wonderful way to contribute to society and make a positive difference in the lives of others. 
      I recently participated in a volunteering campaign called ""Clothes for a Cause,"" which was organized by my school  National Evangelical Institute for Girls and Boys in Saida,Lebanon. The campaign aimed to collect old clothes from students and donate them to an organization that helps underprivileged families.

     When I heard about the campaign, I immediately told the principal that I'm interested in helping others and thus I wanted to  volunteer in this campaign to make a difference in people's lives and impact my community in a positive way. I keenly explained to my peers how their simple act of donating old clothes could have a significant impact on the less fortunate. To my delight, many students responded positively and donated their old clothes.

     As the campaign progressed, the response was overwhelming, and we collected a large and significant amount of clothes. Seeing how students came together for this cause was truly inspiring, and it made me feel proud to be part of such a compassionate and empathetic community.

     After we collected all the clothes, we sorted them, put them in nice colorful bags and then  contacted the  organization that helped underprivileged families. We arranged a day to deliver the clothes, and the organization was delighted with the amount of clothes we had collected. Then the clothes were distributed among the  families in need and I could never forget the joy that I appeared on the children's faces when they opened the bags.

    Volunteering for this campaign was an incredibly fulfilling experience for me. It reminded me of the power of small acts of kindness and how working together can make a significant difference in our communities. I feel fortunate to have been part of the Clothes for a Cause campaign, since helping others made me feel proud of myself. 

    In conclusion, the Clothes for a Cause campaign was a great success, and I am grateful to have been a part of it.

It is a great thing to know that your efforts are improving your neighborhood. It all makes a tremendous difference, from cleaning up a small bit of trash to helping a nonprofit organization with the goal of providing the homeless with food, drink, shelter, or other necessities. I really enjoy being an active member of the community frequently. I believe I am carrying out a necessary task for a vibrant community. While volunteering at Jeel Sustainable Development, I found that they too share the values that the same goal as mine, so that's why I decided to volunteer with them.

The organization that I decided to volunteer with, helps people in need. It helps families in camps and supply them with their needs. Also, it helps patients get their treatment. In addition to that, this organization helps the orphans by giving them their educational needs. It is equally necessary for the fortunate people of society to assist others who are less fortunate, even though community activity does not usually center on environmental issues. Volunteers from the community are welcome to donate items and offer other services to benefit the less fortunate. For instance, people can donate food and clothing to children's homes where they can be catered for, or they can donate these items to street children who have no homes. Members of the society will have contributed to the more pleasant lives of others in this way. Young children in particular will feel joyful. A child's growth and development as well as the support and love they receive from the community depend greatly on this. So,this is what the organization seeks to do. These kinds of volunteering have spared me the opportunity to work with people of different ages, socioeconomic backgrounds, or levels of expertise, to contribute to serve as an integrated unit in order to achieve a communal goal, and have inspired me to recognize the positive aspects and hidden opportunities in a hopeless situation. I now understand what it takes to lead with compassion and persistence and to motivate people to go above and beyond. I've also discovered that by giving, you end up getting more in return.

However, it socially helps to build better connections, more powerful attachments, and closer relationships with others that might last for life. Those 3 days camping we used to have every summer were unforgettable because they were made up of games, fire camps, and the famous charity night where people come to watch our show in order to donate its profit later. 
Subsequently, summer didn’t pass without the “Lebanese Folklore and Heritage Festival” my town arranges every year in August for the past 6 years which it gathers all the people and create this lovely indescribable bond. Acting was my thing and it was a great opportunity to participate and gain some knowledge on everything, so it was amazing just paying the 2 months’ preparation by hearing the people clap for your hard work. Also, the play included an honoring for the legends such as “Rahbani brothers, Fairuz, Nasri Shamseddine…” and we created dabke dances to give the play a rhythm.
